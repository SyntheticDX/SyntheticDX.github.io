If you have installed the original beta version of the multiplayer patch, we strongly recommend that you install the new, final version. This patch includes some important bug fixes and you’ll need it to connect to multiplayer servers. Note that the multiplayer patch INCLUDES the single player patch, so there’s no reason to install both!</div><div>Patch notes for version 1109fm:</div><div><ul><li>Added OpenGL rendering support.</li><li>Misc SP bugfixes. Misc performance improvements.</li><li>Multiplayer support, including DeathMatch and Team DeathMatch.</li><li>5 new multiplayer maps.</li><li>Built in search engine for multiplayer servers.</li><li>All locked doors in multiplayer should close properly now and will not get stuck open.</li><li>Keypads and locked doors lock after 28 seconds instead of 30 seconds. This prevents people from looting the same cabinet twice for one pick attempt.</li><li>Grenade placement animation works correctly now.</li><li>Grenades can no longer be placed on selectable objects (computers, weapons on the weapon rack). This includes doors. This prevents players from hiding grenades behind computers, GEP guns, etc.</li><li>At very low framerates (for the server or singleplayer), lockpicking and multitooling took longer than they should. This has been fixed.</li><li>Pings now sort correctly on the join game screen.</li><li>In multiplayer, when coming out of water, clients occasionally did not get their eye heights adjusted properly, and would appear (to themselves) to be crouched. This has been fixed.</li><li>Elevator buttons should stay in better sync now.</li><li>Next item/ Previous item commands (by default bound to the mousewheel) should work better in multiplayer.</li><li>The inventory screen can no longer be activated at the end of a match.</li><li>The multiplayer scoreboard only highlights your player in gold, even if other players have the same name.</li><li>You can no longer exploit the regeneration augmentation by toggling it on and off very quickly (resulting in almost instant healing for almost no cost).</li><li>Fixed a situation in which cloaked people were occasionally slightly visible just after coming into the room or around a corner.</li><li>Fixed a bug in multiplayer in which you could turn 2 biocells, lockpicks, medkits, grenades, or multitools into a lot by clicking very quickly.</li><li>Fixed a bug in singleplayer in which corpses occasionally became placeholder boxes (garish boxes bearing the legend 'Do not place').</li><li>Fixed a bug in which firing a rapid-fire weapon immediately after drawing it could get the weapon stuck in a bad state.</li><li>Repair bots should no longer be accessible through closed repairbot bay doors in multiplayer.</li><li>The listen client player will not bleed from the previous deathblow after respawn.</li><li>In a DeathMatchGame, if there is a winning tie at all, the match will be called a draw.</li><li>A certain class of cheats was available by using alternate root windows. The standard deathmatch and team deathmatch games now kick players who are using a different root window, and support has been added for mod teams to insist on their own windows.</li><li>Text files can now be read in from packages other than deusextext.u. This affects class Computers (emails/bulletins) and class InformationDevices(datacubes, books, etc). A new property 'TextPackage' specifies the package from which the text comes.</li><li>Targeting augmentation now displays hit location at which you are aiming (head/torso/leg).</li><li>Throwing knife does 17 base damage instead of 25.</li><li>Plasma does 8 base damage instead of 12.</li><li>Energy shield blocks 50% of damage instead of 80%. Drains 25 energy per minute instead of 40.</li><li>You can now chat while dead, while at the end of a match, or while logged into a computer.</li><li>Checkboxes on the join game screen are now slightly more user friendly. Turning off one of team/non-team also turns off the 'show-all' checkbox.</li><li>A GEP gun no longer maintains its lock while reloading. You must get a fresh lock for every shot.</li><li>Leg damage no longer slows you down (unless you completely lose them).</li><li>In team games, you should be less likely to spawn into battles between teammates and enemies.</li><li>Added functionality so that administrators can more easily kick the players that they intend to kick. (See MP Administration doc)</li><li>Singleplayer mods are now able to use classes other than JCDenton for the player character. Override the ApproveClass function in DeusEx.DeusExGameInfo.</li><li>Multiplayer mods can now add new gametypes in configs, as well as new classes and teams. To add new teams, you will need to override the ApproveTeam function in DeusEx.TeamDMGame. New classes and teams will also require new portraits.</li><li>It is now easier to have new gametypes in packages other than DeusEx.u.</li></ul></div><div>Reaction: <a class='pagelink' href='https://web.archive.org/web/20010716072137/http://pub50.ezboard.com:80/fsclansbsboardfrm10.showMessage?topicID=42.topic'>[S] boards</a></div></div>"

This options include the following: admin's mail, admin's pass, admin's name, game password, speed (like mentioned above), toggle autobalance and have the ability to remove certain weapons from the game.</li><li>12- The AugLight used to make the server logs go mad. This has been fixed.</li><li>13- Blooddrops and bloodsplats used to give access nones. This has been fixed.</li><li>14- Someones, access nones would appear when someone got killed. This has been fixed.</li><li>15- Players' IDs and Ping are shown in the scoreboard.

Once a player dies and spectator mode is enabled, he will play as a spectator and allow to view the game in his own view or follow another player (loops betweens players with the fire button).</li><li>19- GPF when typing 'sucide' fixed. Deus Ex used to think someone killed the player, resulting in a GPF. But this has been changed and now fixed.</li><li>20- Add new connection type - ISDN which is set to 5000 as its connection speed. DSL or better's connection speed has been lowered to 10000.</li><li>21- Frag limit has been increased to 50 and Time limit to 60 minutes.</li><li>22- Skill bonus (when you kill someone) has been increased, starting from 250 to 10000.</li><li>23- The Join Game menu screen now shows the current playing players in the selected server.</li><li>24- You are now able to choose from lots of players to play as in DeathMatch and SinglePlayer.</li><li>25- Mutator Support + Mutator selection Menu.

DJPaul and I are working on getting a mod loader feature in DXCBP to make mod loading easy, very efficient and make it easy to allow mods to use DXCBP as a base.</li><li>29- You now dont have to subclass 'PawnGenerator', instead, all you have to do is add our subclass instead and edit its defaultproperties.</li><li>30- The map list can now hold 100 maps (might make it higher later :p)</li><li>31- New MapList editor menu that allows you to edit the maplist inside Deus Ex (still in development, almost finished).</li><li>32- Message Of The Day now shows up when the player enters the server and the server admin can edit it through its own menu.</li><li>33- When you target a turrent or a camera, it will tell you which player is holding control of it (thanks to DarkStalkeR).</li><li>34- IP ban list can now hold up to 500. You can never know when 500 can come in use :P</li><li>35- A few more Access Nones checks has been added.</li><li>36- Player cloaking has been fixed. In user made maps, sometimes you can see players from the other team cloaked, cloaked as in they look like they are on the same team and cloaked.</li><li>37- Sometimes non-water-use weapons sometimes work under water, this has been fixed.</li></ul></div><div>Saturday, May 25, 2002 - Posted by TheRenegadeMaster: Nil Returns<br />Nil has returned to work on DXCBP, he is having a holiday and decided to come back to work on the mod a bit more.
