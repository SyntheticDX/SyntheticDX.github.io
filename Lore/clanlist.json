I dont know whose idea it was but it seemed natural to everybody, so I took up the task to tell Survive and then later also set forums up for our new clan.<br /><br />In very large decentralized social bodies it is natural for various nuclei to emerge, which makes larger groups more challenging to manage as periodic shedding occurs.<br /><br />With the support from my friends I immediately began recruiting anyone promising for our level back then.<br /><br />Early on we picked up my soon-friend Esnight sometime after he was in {HK}: we then went on to {MoH} and finally [NEM]. He was quite competitive player with some SOCOM experience on console, but girls eventually took his attention away from games. Although he lived many many hours in the future we must've been similar enough that leader of {HK} actually confused us two for a single person. I remember he set a goal that if he defeats hardest difficulty minesweeper then he goes and asks girl he likes out. He did both of those things and to my recollection got a positive answer."]

Since at least one clan in the community was presenting winning stats as total frags - the [N/A] clan that Messiah's young sister had been in - the idea to switch to that odd method likely came from there. Ultimately clans assume war is decided based on native game victory conditions, and unless both clans excplicitly agree on a victory condition then such shenanigans can happen. As I always made victory condition clear for all of my challenges, I believe [DEA] surely must've had that detail made very clear as well. In [N/A] case I believe they just liked presenting stats for website and none of their wars look like it was decided by total score.

The clan was officially established on 25th of January, 2002, when the first website and forums were also publicly launched. The name was later on changed to The Brotherhood of Triad to emphasize the fraternal unity of the clan, the equality of its members and the autocratic governing structure. The members of tBoT were to revolutionize how the game was played, being zealous pioneers who endlessly and nearly scientifically developed new strategies, methods and techniques to beat their opponents. From a new prospect tBoT quickly grew to become a semi-secret society, an elite club for the few and selected, which was to dominate the servers."]

I then randomly happened upon Phantom waiting in public before scheduled match - ex clan mate in REN and now one leader figure in this clan - and I decided to throw away my mortal feud with him and asked if he can give me war password. To my surprise he did, probably realizing the strength of the opponent. He even sorted out which member is absent that can lend me the name and tag - it turned out to be the young and fierce Frenchman (NKz)Bam whose role I then assumed. In hindisight I am not sure if I joined for the first map or if it was already the second map in shape of CMD and the first one had not gone so well.<br /><br />I had a good strong going on CMD headshotting Spaz just seconds in, Fullmoon very soon quit the match, Phantom lasted entire map but did not stay for Silo. I believe my score was nicely positive which against the likes of Monkee and Ste and Spaz and whoelse happened to be there was good, Phantom I believe was struggling to maintain an even score even with his speedhack and camping - I remember him having something like 21-22 or something like that, other NKz who played were not a threat to opponent. On Silo I just chilled with who I think were two brothers, from Italy or US or Im not sure from where, we were possibly a man down and at this point it was A!B hunting me on an open map. Later I heard that the mysteriously good performance of some noob called Bam was creating discussion among opponent behind the scenes as the match progressed, and Dani who saw the screenshots figured Bam mustve played the game of his life. Considering Bam said he'd stab me during some discussion on forums a while earlier, it made it all the more funnier. NKz never stood a chance in this war and A!B was aware of it, likely just focusing on outsmarting the speedhacking powercouple Phantom-Fullmoon.","isCertain"]

Other leaders trancekiller and TheSeal were all given a third power over the clan, which was soon coming to an end due to TheSeal's negativity, towards the clan, resulting in multi-clanning. Recruiting was initiated immediately after it's reimbursement with new members snipemastaKEV, asterisk, and an ex [A]ssassin member, RoBo...

                "backgroundStory" : ["","alpha","","Founded in early September of 2003, through the ideals and efforts of Daedalus, the clan grew its origins through the common goal of gaming throughout the Deus Ex Multiplayer community, and the passion to keep that way of gaming alive. An attraction of views and opinions on the way the game would be played, and the attitudes that should be portrayed through active gaming throughout the DXMP scene made the clan establish its roots with the first members of many — DoughBoy, Alex, James and Darren.<br /><br />The clan became widely known as |ALPHA|, gaining the interest & intrigue of many, though causing controversy and spite to stir in others as the clan climbed up through the ranks. When a merge was made in early 2004 with another clan, proposed to ensure better skills through the exchange of knowledge and time, it caused others to privately question the integrity of Alpha as a community, but proved to be ill-founded, as the pact with the [A]ssassins proved to be strong and wise. The [A]lliance was born, improving the competitive edge on the Alpha community through the development of new skills and tactics. These new skills not only included the development of augmented game play; from the mass of the Alpha community came forth editors of all aspects, including coders, modelers, and mappers. To this day, Alpha is known for its skilled but modest editing community, and is suggested upon to enhance and strengthen the DXMP community, from both those who would choose to attempt to destroy the agreeable way of gaming in the DXMP community, and the ideals and views of peers that have malicious intent to the game nonetheless.<br /><br />Having since regained its former name, and adapting to the new in-game tag that it has acquired from the merge with [A]ssassins, the [A]lpha clan continues to stand out from the crowd to provide a strong opposition to any clan on any type of Deus Ex game play style, through the variety of game type preference found within the ranks of the clan; both augmented and non-augmented game type challenges are accepted and carried out with good faith and respect. [A]lpha is unique by its well established dynamic use of both modding and gaming enhancements to the DXMP scene; the [A]lpha Labs are well-known for their regular releases of well-made, effective mods and mutators for the DXMP community, allowing the clan to truly live up to its reputation and aim — 'We fight for Deus Ex', not only through well-mannered game play, but through the maintenance and well-being of the integrity of the game itself through the [A]lpha Labs."]

I'll quote Zora, the developer of Nephthys mod, who was contacting with the GameSpy representative:<q>Yes, it's true, GameSpy changed the master server to prevent some attacker from exploiting the master server list to blind out 'unwanted' Deus Ex servers.<br />The last weeks I was in contact with a GameSpy developer to track down the problem and put up a work-around. The final change is running since today and many of you already noticed the full server list. :)<br />This core problem was fixed about 2 years ago, but unfortunately Deus Ex wasn't supported by the original game developer any more, so there wasn't anyone who applied the necessary fix to the game itself.<br />GameSpy, although not in charge for that, changed the behaviour of their master server to keep the Deus Ex game alive and allow all game servers to be listed. Although noone payed them for this old game, they don't accept an attacker dictating a certain game style.</q>Thumbs up! ","community"]

Mostly we're fighters, but the clan also consists UnrealEd modders and some members are just hosters. As you can see from the name of our clan, [A]lliance, is a merge between two Deus Ex Mulitplayer clans, [A]ssassins and |ALPHA|. [A]ssassins were a clan oriented on warring, while |ALPHA| were mostly modders, who did not play very often. The union of these clans appeared in the March 2004. [A]lliance is fighting for Deus Ex MultiPlayer (DXMP) and we don't accept any other games. We're trying to keep slightly dieing Deus Ex community alive as far as it is possible, until the last server closes and last player uninstalls the game. We like DXMP, we earned the great skills of online game playing and every game is interesting and fun for us.<br /><br />Since the end of August 2004, [A]lliance has became a fully warring clan. We're shortening our editing (modding) parts, so as the zero-aug (condition) players. We're slightly moving to become at least, halfly 'augged' clan, a clan, that plays only gametypes that includes unique Deus Ex augmentation system in it. We have taken on certain members who are willing to help [A] achieve this status. It doesn't mean, that we won't play in other game types, no, we will play in other games types, but our orientation will be on ATDM (advanced team death match) conditions. Since this new era, that started in the end of August 2004, we will play trainings regularly, at least, once a week. We'll try to organise clanwars and quick matches as much as it is possible. Very soon, there will be more and more 24 hour a day and 7 days a week servers up with our clan tag [A] on-line.<br /><br />Talking about [A]lliance, its history, we can't forget our projects. Even after August clan re-organisation, sure we'll keep our projects and it's development. Projects - are divisions of our clan, which work for some exact tasks. The most popular project, is, probably, FunLine. Everyone, even legends of battles and wars of DXMP had ever seen one of our FunLine maps. There are other projects like, HiQ maps project - maps, that are oriented on warring. MiniMachina project was born tto fix the gameplay, bugs, adding new features by using simple little mutators for DXMTL; most of mutators are currently in development.<br /><br />[A]lliance continues to be a good, friendly clan, a family, in contrary to famous opinion. Our members are interesting, kind and clever personalities so you will be able to enjoy games with us and socialise with us, out of game. There are a lot of people who like us, supported and still supports us in any given situation, even when this person is in another clan. To know more about us, visit our forum, where you can quickly get a full answer on any question about [A] (so as about Deus Ex, gameplay, technical problems and etc) you need. "]

This new theme will require me to edit maps. The new server theme will be called DXvsUT. A long time ago players were introduced to the 7MB Tnag mod and its mutator which was something which convered all weapons into UT weapons. After a while players started asking for the DX weapons. The new server theme is a halfway conversion from deus ex to UT weapons. Because it is impossble to create a mod which will do only half the job. I will have to re-edit all the maps involved in this theme. DXvsUT will be in front of every map, that way players will know this is a map type. The focus of this is to integrate UT weapons into deus ex without taking weapons or sacrificing gameply. Since the Tnag mod is the most balanced weapon mod out tere I believe that both weapon sets compete with each other well and allows gameplay to determine victory over weapon damages. The idea is to exchange some of the deus ex spawnzone weapons for the UT weapons and to modify spawnzones so that both sides, the DX and UT players can equally compete against one another. At first DX gamers will have the advantage since they knoiw the weapon damages and skill alocation as well as familiarity with the DX weapons, later on players will learn how to use the UT weapons as I have to counter the DX weapons and vice versa. Aside fom re editing all maps involved for this I will also edit maps for gameplay, those maps that are in need of an overhaul. With new weapons come new power and strategy, so My judgement will be tested in the way I balance out te playing field. Players will have access to both weapon sets. I can work at this project alone, but for advice I will turn to experienced players and clan leaders. The downside to this project is that players will have to download the maps and the Tnag mod, but there is much more to be aware of and the chain of predicatability will finaly broken and deus ex will finaly be refreshed. DXvsUT is the first conversion Im working on and I will make the maps available later on. So far Im working on DXvsUT_Area51bunker and I hope I can deal with the five basic maps first before moving on to the others..","server"]

It finally got going after arranging it 3 times, but never really started. AOD werent there on time, and when they did turn up, they had an imposter posing as (AOD)Redcomet. Turns out the real redcomet had asked (BTJ)MadFragger to go in2 the match and pretend to be an aod member. It was obvious from the beginning due to the fact that (no offense intended to AOD), he was just too good to be a member of theirs. The real redcomet then came in2 the server and said that the good player was a fake. After threats of banning all AOD from the server, it eventually got called off, for a slagging match to start in the deus ex lobby of gamespy arcade (i think we won that one ;p).

Not only is he an invaluable player, but he has (and hopefully will again, when he gets his server fixed up) hosted a dedicated Assassins Unlimited server. Kudos to him. Also, I changed around the two newest entries (dRamA and Meremoth) so that they will be in alphabetical order with the rest on the members page.

I purchased Half-Life over two years ago and I still play Team Fortress Classic to this day. Deus Ex's multiplayer, while obviously fun, doesn't have the correct formula to keep people interested. Ion Storm made a huge mistake when they released the patch and then ignored the public. Their documentation was lackluster and the design flaws were downright maddening. Deus Ex has since refused to operate correctly on my computer, the patch doesn't do what anyone wants it to, and the game just doesn't have enough to offer. There was great potential, but Ion Storm screwed up. I'm incredibly sorry and saddened to say this. Especially since I consider myself to be personal friends with and teammate to everyone who is in the clan. Nate and I know we let you down, and we apologize.<br /><br />Of course, we did a lot of work for Assassins Unlimited. A LOT. It's probably not even evident. We hear there's talk of starting a new clan, Ninja. We welcome the change and respect it and wish to offer our blessings. However, AU can remain. I am willing to give to anyone who will accept (or who receives by a vote) the leadership of this clan and its website. We want Assassins Unlimited to go on with a more dedicated staff and we know some of you can do it. If you all make a decision to take AU as it is, let me know one last time, and it's yours.<br /><br />Good luck, comrades. It's a jungle out there; but we're unlimited.<br /><br />Excelsior!","clan"]

A long time ago we know.<br /><br />And the clan was going well, actually very well indeed, after I discovered i't, we got a few members, and I invited Féar to lead with me.<br /><br />Our original forum was at http://b2sclan.myfreeforum.org then we move on to www.puffinhost.com/b2sclan. Suddenly I disappered during the middle of 2006 for a while and could not get an source of contact. The clan I heard was still going strong with Féar leading and the ß2S members staying active.<br /><br />By the end of 2006 ß2S died, with only a few more members left. But around June 2007 Harry tried to revive the clan, but saddly failed. So I joined the Deus Ex community again July and started playing Deus Ex again, and got the idea of starting up ß2S. And started it back up the 24th of August 2007. And I am glad I did because we are trying to help the Deus Ex community stay strong and playing fairly.<br /><br />We are now a 0-Augged clan, but we can play augs, not as well as 0-augs though. We currently have 8 members: Survive, Psycho, 0o7, Dutch, Obliviater, Sin, Giiju and Dextructor.<br /><br />Our forums are at www.b2sclan.com/forum</p> - Thanks for reading, Survive.<br /><br />*Coming Soon* ScreenShot - ß2S Will Hopefully Enter In To Wolfenstein Enemy Territory Soon!"]

We did not loose as badly as we could have (given the calibre of our opponents) and I don't think we gave ourselves the best chance.<br /><br />I will be on holiday until about January and may not have a chance to check emails until then.

We had to wait a couple of minutes so that we would get the different team in etc. &#x005B;BK&#x005D; played 10 minutes from the cathedral map and then for some reason, they started leaving the server. Only &#x005B;BK&#x005D;Amigo stayed at the server but it was impossible to continue with 1 v 5 team...then &#x005B;BK&#x005D;Apostle informed that the match is over.

We all had ADSL, and we totally started to play both Counter Strike and Deus Ex. Pige and Hyperion got better and better in CS and semisonic in DX.

NGUK.net is now days only real server and there is too few admins and they can make invidual decisions, which isn't good because everyone knows almost everyone in DXMP and admins can make decisions, which aren't fair but are made by personal issues. There is also many bugs in latest DXMP patch and what I have heard there aren't made a new one. It's also very easy to cheat in DXMP thought there is some cheat protects. Luckily its easy to see if someone is cheating but how can you stop him because there never is a admin online. Someday it's gonna be get better but not for a while thought that's for sure.

The clan began when two masters of their art, The4thDenton and sliff22, discovered a hilarious glitch in the game and joined forces to ensure that the world would know the power of the Chicken Dance. This technique has since been prevented by the evil new 1112fm patch, but the spirit of the Chicken Dance will live on forever.<br /><br /><p>Welcome to the home of the [CDP] Clan! The purpose of this site is to inform visitors about the [CDP] Clan and to provide resources useful to both experienced gamers and newbies. An 'Info' section including a current clan roster is provided for those unfamiliar with the [CDP] Clan. A 'Strategy' section is provided so as to educate visitors about the ways of the [CDP] and how to play Deus Ex multiplayer effectively. Those interested in joining the [CDP] Clan should check out the 'Join' section of this website. If it is DXMP multiplayer maps you seek, we offer over 44 multiplayer maps for download in the 'Downloads' section of this site. We also provide 'Links' to sites related to the game and to other clans. A 'Members' section exists for the use of [CDP] Clan members.</p><h1>Join</h1><p>Are you interested in joining the [CDP] Clan? Here are some facts and figures to help you make up your mind.</p><p>The [CDP] Clan has members in North America, Australia, and Europe, which means there's a good chance you'll find a member of [CDP] online at the same time you are.</p><p>All [CDP] Clan members are provided with their own e-mail address at cdpclan.com.</p><p>Members of major clans, such as the [CDP], are feared by clan-less players and can be quite intimidating when they attack in unison.</p><p>Having experienced clansmen by your side means you won't get ganged up on and spawnkilled by amoral bastards.</p><p>If you are interested in joining the [CDP] Clan, e-mail either The4thDenton at /../ or sliff22 at /../.

Merlin was downright post-menstrual. I can understand the frustrations and I apologize, on behalf of CG, for causing a situation in which you had to leave the game. I wish I could offer guarantees that that would never happen again. We simply didn't have enough people signed up to serve as backups. no one was available at the time. In the future, I hope that all CG members will make every effort to be on MSN and available at match times should someone not show. As I've said privately to a few of your members, you gave us a great match. Not much a challenge for you, but it was fun, we got a few good licks in, and realized how much we have yet to learn. My vote for Match MVP: Merlin...... he was there consistently when I had one of you guys almost killed, and he nailed me good. Merlin is the best player I have seen in DXMP in terms of coming in to support a fallen team member. Great job, Merl! And all of I, very well played. I am also proud of the CG guys who played. you stuck with it. And that is equally admirable. Lesser men -- whether by fear or wounded ego -- would have fled the scene.

If you choose to move from CYD to the new clan i will also have to ask you to give a bit more commitment (i know you all ready do give lots) as i wont be able to do as much.<br />If/When we get the new clan set up we can re-arrange the wars with APC (i can't be bothered with the likes of TCN, hehe) and maybe some other clans!<br /><br />However if you wish to stay with CYD then i will give the password to anyong that wants to take charge, and they can update the site, etc.<br /><br />well sorry about this guys :( and i would hope you would start a new clan with me<br /><br />:( Verb</p>"]

Belouga recently left [DA] to join [TCNdk], and now plays under the alias of Garfield. With his departure, Parallax and Java stepped up to be the new Co-Leaders.

Clan played augs early and select members were very good at it, particularly at the start of year 2005 when DCSB prestige was peaking, but the S tier belongs to their zero-aug play that was compatible with their other titles of interest. Notably, clan branched out to SOF from August 2003. Dramatically calling it quits in DXMP mid-2005, the clan was active in other games seemingly up until 2008 when activity seems to have died. Its late roster featured various active players of [T] clan but mostly for other games. In our game there would soon appear some echos of DCSB in shape of brief clan-like groups of no competitive depth such as AAGP and FMG both involving ex member Motionm@n and another ex member Ferdvds was also in one or both.",

Here is a list of things we expect of you as a DCSB member.<br /><br />1). CHEATERS SUCK!! We do not agree with cheating, and any members caught doing so will be kick from the clan instantly.<br />2). We will not have multiclanners. If you want to be with another clan, then join them, if you want to be with us, then join us, not both. Members caught multiclanning will be given the choice, us, or them.<br />3). We will not have spawnkillers, team killers, type killers, or any other form of taking advantage of a player and killing him because he cannot defend himself.<br />4). You are a reasonably active player in DXMP. Members that have not been seen or heard from for 3 weeks will be put on a list of players that have not been in contact, and after 2 months we will presume you are no longer with us for any reason, and will be taken off the website.<br />5). Please respect all DXMP's in the community. We do not want to be getting complaints from people saying that you have been causing trouble. In this case appropriate action will be taken."]

Before its death, there was a running joke that DC stood for Dead Cows after the hacker group when a public player made the mistake. After its death RogueJedi and Blade made the joke that the 'dead cows would strike back' and began to wear a DCSB tag! hence the name, Dead Cows Strike Back.<br /><br />Lead by Mole, DCSB was origionally a non competitive, fun clan made up of 4 local friends and a couple of other guys with the same interests of having some fun in Deus Ex MultiPlayer. We grew in strength over time going from our Tripod hosted website onto hosting our own domain (origionally dxcows.com, and later dcsb.co.uk) and forums. We built ourselves into a highly respected clan, involved in many community based projects from maps and mods to websites and tutorials.<br /><br />Eventually DCSB began to branch out. We had played other games here and there but never really gotten into them fully, until Unreal 2: eXpanded MultiPlayer.<br />In January 2004 we entered into the first season of the Jolt XMP League (JXL) and with Mole, Nexus, and OnYx at the helm we began to build a team. Everything seemed to be in pieces until it all fell into place just before our first match, winning that and a scrim shortly after it.<br />Suddenly we realised that playing organised matches side by side with your clan mates was alot more enjoyable than just playing publics (there were never many clan games in DXMP). And so began an area of playing up to 3 clan games per night 7 days a week and being a little more competitive. The clan was involved in many things community-wide. Administration and playing in leagues, hosting of servers though 2 members own hosting company, casting scrims and matches with XMPTV, even designing and creating our own XMP mod, Raptor Race 2004.<br /><br />As the XMP scene died off at the end of 2004, so did the XMP side of DCSB. Nexus chose to leave and create a new clan, Clan[1] and Mole made the decision to mix the 2 sides of DCSB (XMP and DXMP, formerly separate websites, forums, players, etc) into one clan. Clashes eventually lead to alot of the XMP players going to Clan[1] and sticking together out of friendship. for that same reason, even though not all are in the same clan the old XMP team are still very much in contact to the present.<br /><br />In January 2005 a rebuilding process began and BFG stepped up to help in a leadership role and keep the balance as we began to get into newer games. By the time the clan split was over we were already into HL2DM. Zebib and ZerF joined the clan and went on to prove themselves as the #1 2vs2 team in europe. Although we managed to pick up 2 other top players including Sono (of Mousesports), 4 vs 4 HL2DM didnt really pick up for us and the game soon died off.<br /><br />Mole announced DCSB's official retirement from DXMP in August of 2005, and the year was one of wandering from one game to the next. We played Counterstrike: Source for a few months, competing in the Team Warfare Leagues and reaching a top 3 position in all 3 of the European ladders there, but the team died off with a cleanout of the members list in an effort to make a more mature community.<br />The DCSB guild was also formed in Guild Wars as a bit of a time waster while waiting to find a good team based FPS we could all get into.<br /><br />January 2006 saw Spoon and Airwalk drag DCSB into the Dystopia community. We entered into the leagues and got involved on forums, IRC, and anything we could to help in the upkeep of the small community. Mole became an admin for the Dystopia Global league, as well as Mole, BFG, Spoon, and Bob Dole being offered positions on the Dystopia beta testing team.<br />Sadly the Dystopia community went south as the game became less enjoyable. Those of us testing the full V1 release found it to not quite be the 'holy grail' it was thought to be and the competitive scene died off as more and more players dropped off from the game.<br />In November Airwalk took over the Dystopia side of DCSB, arranging the teams and finding players that could play for a DCSB side without becoming full DCSB members so that those that wanted to play some games still could. Soon enough Airwalks efforts have paid off and we once again have a growing team competing in the league, and he has also brought some new faces to DCSB that have become full cows thanks to how well they have fit in with the rest of us.<br /><br />After a brief time in Battlefield 2142, playing 4 scrims and winning all 4, April 2007 saw DCSB begin playing recently released Half Life 2 mod Revolt: The Decimation."]

I do have a temporary replacement for the moment, but have decided to leave CT2k2 until i get my laptop back.<br /><br />We have given up on a war with AOD now. It finally got going after arranging it 3 times, but never really started. AOD werent there on time, and when they did turn up, they had an imposter posing as (AOD)Redcomet. Turns out the real redcomet had asked (BTJ)MadFragger to go in2 the match and pretend to be an aod member. It was obvious from the beginning due to the fact that (no offense intended to AOD), he was just too good to be a member of theirs. The real redcomet then came in2 the server and said that the good player was a fake. After threats of banning all AOD from the server, it eventually got called off, for a slagging match to start in the deus ex lobby of gamespy arcade (i think we won that one ;p). If you dont understand this, then post on our forums and all will be explained further.<br /><br />The friendly with TCNdk also didnt go too well. Only 2 dcsb members turned up, RogueJedi and Demolitionman. They had a little fun but nothing ever really happened. It was re-arranged for this wkend just gone, but had to be canclled due to the fact that Blade, Rogue, and myself had other commitments saturday night, and myself and blade have another commitment tonight as well(sunday). We will discuss a new date in the private area of the forums, and get back to TCNdk with one.<br /><br /><br />Also, i have updated the links page due to the fact that Assasins have changed to Thug Nation (i am currently making a website for them at the moment), and Immortals and Blitzkreigers(hope i spelt that right) have merged to form new clan Divine.","wars"]

My reason for this is that they are currently making a new website and forum, therefore the ones that were in our links were no longer valid.<br /><br />And while on the subject of website modification, I have trimmed the site a little and taken out some of the sections that are no longer needed. Due to the fact that The Source was origionally made for private DCSB use, but it is now available to the public, I have just put a link to there in the links section so that people can download form there rather than here. I have also gotten rid of the Wars section, as this I feel is too much updating and we dont need to try and boast about who we won/lost/ and played against. And obviously due to reasons to follow, the tournament sections are now gone.<br /><br />I have decided not to start the tournament again. Instead I have been asked to join the Deusex-Online team andwill be working on a new project over there that will be of the same nature, only slightly different. Keep an eye out for the official upcoming launch date, at which point all will be revealed.<br /><br />I would also like to welcome the latest addition to the DCSB roster, welcome [DCSB]Keysersoze. Keyser is a lethal shot with a sniper rifle, and can be pretty mean with a pistol too. He is loyal, and im sure will make a great addition to the team.<br /><br />Although with the good news, also comes some bad. Not long before Keyser joined us, Vaga has decided to leave. Due to time zones we rarely saw each other, and due to this he thought we werent an active enough clan. Fact is, for us to play with/against him, us in the UK would have had to have stayed up pretty late everr night. We are sorry to see him go. Aurnie is also no longer with us. He was removed from the clan due to the fact that he was breaking the clan rules by multiclanning. We accepted his explanations for so long, and eventually had enough. He never played with a tag on, more often he had a [T]ranscend tag, and when we did enter the same server as him, he left or claimed it was his brother on his PC. Again time was also a factor with him, as he was in Canada. So now we are back to being a full UK clan.<br /><br />And on a final note, I have created a new website for the community to use to download maps, mods, patches, and to find out other information in general. It offers direct downloads, instead of having to go throught all the hassle of Edge Networks and/or FilePlanet. I hope everyone finds The Source useful.","clan"]

Late nights, early mornings, and have come to a decision regarding the direction the clan is going in. I can only do this once so I better get it right! lol.<br />The following decision is not one I have come to easily, nor am I taking it lightly as its regarding DCSB heritage.<br /><br />As of today Dead Cows Strike Back will no longer be an active part of the Deus Ex MultiPlayer community.<br />I have enjoyed a great deal in the past within the community through highs and lows on both a personal and a clan level, however I now feel it is time to move on.<br />Some members that still play may still be using the tag (and they're welcome to, I hope they all stay with us), while others may move onto joining another clans in DXMP only. You may still see 1 or 2 individual members in the game, but the clan in general will no longer be a DXMP clan as a whole as it is now retiring from activity.<br />However what I do know... <br /><br />/../","clan"]

Good game.<br /><br />-- A long-awaited match between two undefeated clans, it appears that the more experienced clan found ways to defeat Triad by maps, forcing the brothers to quickly find alternate ways post-match to interpret it as a win instead, and thus save their supposedly flawless rating - although already their [TCN] match was technically a draw but not counted as one. Since at least one clan in the community was presenting winning stats as total frags - the [N/A] clan that Messiah's young sister had been in - the idea to switch to that odd method likely came from there. Ultimately clans assume war is decided based on native game victory conditions, and unless both clans excplicitly agree on a victory condition then such shenanigans can happen. As I always made victory condition clear for all of my challenges, I believe [DEA] surely must've had that detail made very clear as well. In [N/A] case I believe they just liked presenting stats for website and none of their wars look like it was decided by total score. At least one map is on Youtube uploaded by DBL. I believe I saw the leader decade later admitting to being overconfident going in. --","isCertain"]

(This is not related to DMI at all).<br /><br />I guess most will know the reason for my departure, but I might as well reveal all. I write this with regret and sorrow. After a long thought during the past two days, I feel that I am now struggling to keep up with the DXMP Community, and I am left with no options but to leave. Having been around in the DXMP Community since December 7th, the DEA clan now 6 months and 11 days old, I feel disappointed with myself, but I am left with little option but to choose this path.<br />I personally believe that I have tried to the best of my ability to serve the community, and have been successful in some occasions. However, it has been disastrous recently, with failed talks with ISA for e.g. the patch, and conflicts with members within the community. The DXMP Community as a whole is great, and is something you would rarely see in other communities. However, I think my time is up, and that I can no longer provide as much as I can.<br />The DXMP game is too buggy, players are not willing to abide by the rules to play on servers, e.g. NGUK, and it makes life extremely difficult for someone like myself who dedicate time to this community. The closure of PDX Conspiracy is one of the biggest hits to the community, with many players disappearing. Problems arise many thanks to cheats being exploited and bug abuse, which contributes to a major factor to my departure as trying to stop people using them is impossible and spending the past week trying to control it and identify the real cheaters are most difficult. Being an admin. of a public server is difficult, although I felt that PDX Conspiracy was by far easier with players working together to ensure the DXMP game is played fairly and any problems are instantly reported to myself or admins that are assigned to looking after PDX.<br />With no new patch coming out, the DXMP game is deteriorating. I guess most of you can see what I am trying to say. I can't blame players for moving to other games such as Tribes 2, CS, or any other games, let alone UT! For the past few weeks, I can see that things are starting to deteriorate and some problems can be said to be caused by no one but myself. I guess its time to move on.<br />This is something I know I will regret but my decision is final. I understand that many have attempted to persuade me to return and some will continue to persuade me, but I am very very sorry that this is no longer possible. The most recent account of my wrong doing, spying on players and clans is something I have gone off the line with. However, I feel that this was necessary, but I can see trouble will stir. I'd better leave to keep the community in peace, yet again, my bad. I apologise in public to all those I have stirred trouble with, and especially to the DMI clan, who will probably not forgive me for my wrongdoing. Sorry!!<br />I will probably make one last apology, which is to my clan members, in which without them, will not have brought me so far into DXMP. I would like to apologise to them and hope they accept my apology for my disappointing decision. Of course, I will probably pop back occasionally or stay in touch with some people from the DXMP Community via ICQ, e-mail, etc… but I have decided to advanced forward.<br /><br />It’s been cool to know a lot of you guys, whether it was flaming or just happy chatting and there are a few things I have learnt whilst being in this community and learning to accept mistakes is one thing for definite that I need to accept. Finally, I wish everyone (friend or enemy) the best of luck in the future.<br /><br /><em>--------------------<br /><br />What You See Is What You Might Not Get! - slicer<br />Former Leader and Founder of the Deus Ex Assassins [DEA] Clan<br />DEA Site: click here<br /><br />Former Administrator of the Gamespy PlanetDeusEx Conspiracy Server<br />Administrator of NGUK (NetGames UK) DXMP Servers</em>"]

He already had a list of people wanting to be a part of it, and asked if I was interested. I told him I didn't want to be part of any clan except DMI, and wished him luck with it. I honestly thought Immortals would go the same way Reactors went. Some time later, TM told me he got into DEA. It wasn't very long until I got an email from Joe asking me to join as well.

They had all been gone for awhile and I joined with the wildest dreams of somehow making them all come back. With Craig aboard adding a 2nd active member, my dreams came true. Before I knew it I was playing along side the legends of the game, and we added Melkor. I was a tanker at the time and with the exception of Blamer, tanking wasnt the DEA MO. I wanted to play the over the top game that they had mastered. I immediately changed my power recirc to speed and began playing the speed game. Man was it a hard transition. I was easily the worst player in the clan at the time. But the style I would eventualy master, the speed tanker with vision, would live on to this day as the favorite of many of the post-DEA era's top players. Anyway, for a few months DEA was in full swing again. This should have been the last stand. The clan soon stopped playing again and it was I that begged for new recruits as I was in my prime and wanted to the DEA name to shine. I was granted limted recruiting rights and brought Druid aboard /../<br /><br /><em>(Note: continues in Stories section describing attempts to revive DEA from mid to later evolution)</em>"]

Many times in a clan a member's rank and experience is not known to his or her clanmates or fellow players, and this ranking system eliminates these problems. The symbols indicate the following:<br /><br />[*] = Clan Leader -- These are clan commanders and the founders of the clan. The only people wearing these insignias will be Illuminati-IIS, SilentAssassin, and Bunny<br /><br />[^] = Clan General -- These are clan leaders just below the founders, and they help orchestrate matches as well as arbitrate clan problems and help make decisions. Each general will command a squad of regulars.<br /><br />[=] = Regular -- These are the soldiers of the clan. Members of sutible skills as well as trainees who have exhibited sufficient skills are awarded this rank. Regulars server under generals in squadrons.<br /><br />[T] = Trainee -- Trainees are players who have mastered the basics of Deus Ex, but require either additional training or experience to advance to the rank of regular.</p>"]

                "article" : ["","2001-07-15","15/07/2001","","The Clan Event is getting off the ground. I'm still waiting on one of you to offer your computer, but after speaking to Dark0hmN I believe that it will not be that hard to setup as I originally thought. Once one of you has confirmed you can bring your computer, I will begin making arrangements for network cables, netwrok cards and a hub. I'm hoping Bob Shoemark could supply these, or maybe one of you, but if not I can just buy them and be done with it. More soon. I've also decided on the server settings, after some fiddling and testing. The server will be an Deathmatch server, set to the regulations of an Advanced Team Deathmatch game, as this is the mode in which most of us seems comfortable (Boris, I'm sure you'll manage). The server will run 7 maps - Area51Bunker, Cathedral, Silo, CMD, Smuggler, Towers and NYC-Streets. If you do not have any of these maps I will copy them across the network so we don't have to waste any time in game. It would be a ultra-fast download anyway. I was considering running Villa, but after some playtesting I decided aginast it as it is a somewhat unfair level, with not all weapons being available, thus favouring people used to the weapons at hand. And the fact that you have 3 LAMs under the bed ready to go is ludicrous. So, I have dropped Villa for this match. However, if some of you desperately want to include it, I'll reconsider my decision and include it in the server. The server will be dedicated and for monitoring purposes I do have the Remote Webserver installed. I will be the only one with Admin access, and I suggest you read the list of rules that the NGUK servers have just released, as I will be running these rules. These rules are available through Face's site, FaceDesigns.co.uk. Breaking these rules will not be tolerated, and you will forfeit the match. I do intend to have some prizes ready to be handed out to the victor, but there will also be prizes for other achievements, ie most kills overall, least deaths overall, and I will also award a comical award for the funniest kill/death. I'm drawing up a table for the round-robin at the moment, however I'll leave it to whoever is perceived as the weaker player to pick the map, so as to even it up a little. Once we're done with the round-robin, I'll get rid of most of the rules and we'll get down to just having some fun, and if I haven't done so by then, I'll add Villa to the server. ","clan"]

I know, I haven't posted for a while. I've been working up to 10 hours a day, and while it certainly only makes me more cynical, the amount of effort I can dedicate to expressing that cynicism is inversely proportional to the length of time worked. It's also more satisfying seeing the physical result of snide remarks than making them towards a largely imaginary audience here. Nevertheless, since the coming decades are being heralded as the time of Islam, it's time to enjoy one of the last few christmases the world may get to indulge in. I've had a pretty awesome day but a hell of a lot of people seem to be depressed by the holiday season for varying reasons. I've once again compiled one of my much fabled lists of christmas gifts, so without further ado, here's what you're all getting:<br />Leon - AIDS.<br />Nomad - A bowl of condoms and some courage.<br />Mirage - A buxom teen with dark hair, dark music tastes, her own car and income.<br />Blake - a real car, broadband.<br />James - better coworkers.<br />Forty - a dictionary and a clue.<br />Dufus - a PhD.<br />McSpud - a family.<br />Mole - a ticket to a country that actually wins at sport.<br />Everyone else gets whatever they want that costs less than $3.50.<br />Now I know many of you leave your shopping to the last minute, so in the spirit of the season I'm also going to throw some gift ideas around.<br />36 Crazyfists - A Snow Capped Romance - From the brilliant open of At The End of August to the mountainous climax of Waterhaul, A Snow Capped Romance is one of the greatest CDs you will ever hear. There isn't a single weak song on the CD which is incredibly rare - you can listen to the entire thing without skipping a beat over and over and still love it. If you're buying for a metalhead, get this and be loved.<br />Stephen King - The Dark Tower - Join the quest for the Dark Tower with Roland of Gilead, the last gunslinger of a long lost civilisation. From humble beginnings in the Gunslinger King crafts one of the most epic, entrancing and utterly awesome heroic fantasy series ever penned. The characters are horribly mismatched and yet somehow manage to work together beautifully, and since King chooses to focus only on this small ka-tet of 5 instead of spreading himself thin on dozens of characters like George R R Martin with A Song of Ice and Fire, each character is wonderfully deep. None surpass Roland himself though, and Wizard and Glass may just be the best book you'll ever read.","community"]

Leader Spike kicked everyone who didn't read website or hear his request for feedback out after DanDeMan-Marije conflict, as well as dropping leadership, but it appears that following weeks he took DF to a second round and re-established clan with new site design and forums. Not two weeks after the dutch SHADOW announced death of DF right at the end of 2004 another player called Excorcist seems to have revived the clan for the fifth year yet there are no significant signs of activity left. Although the dutch founder was no longer in the clan the group at its peak had several players from Low Countries.",

But after a while the clan started to go down hill we decided to change the tag to [LZ] which was ok for a while till it died again. So then Bobodaknifa and myself thought it was time for a new clan we got [DF] we was doing very well for a while but then things started to go wrong I had been disconnected from the internet and Bobodaknifa was having a few troubles of his own the clan started loosing more wars and members.<br />By the time I got back on the net [DF] was dieing then before I knew it the clan was dead Bobodaknifa had become [A]Bobodaknifa I was not very happy so I went freelance again but after all that time in wars and being part of a team was starting to hit me so I joined [A].<br />Then one day I was having a fight with a player called ][UNI][BattleAngel she asked me if I wanted to join ][UNI][ so I did. We got to know each other a bit better and I introduced her to Bobodaknifa he told me that she wanted to make [DF] again so I asked her if it was true she said yes. So now here we are again with 2 new leaders and loads of new good members we are a better clan then before. After all this that has happened ][DF][ will never die we will stay strong and we are always looking for a good game.<br /><br />We have a Fair Clan policy what means you may be in more clans if you are intrested in Augs. DF is still working on it. We hope to become specialist in augs soon"]

Previous members graduated to other top tier clans until DK itself merged into [TCN] and influenced its eventual rebranding into GHOST. Between the ages of the core group and being largely North America based it had a lot in common with the few months later clan CG, but appears to have been more ambitious of the two. With the third year the returning and now seasoned veterans used their experience and reputation to breathe new life into the clan that died in merge - their friends in many other clans went through a similar evolution. What seems to have started as clan revival by Epidemic culminated with him and SoulSnatcher leaving the clan around June, latter to reform [iOi] - although ends up creating or joining [vL] instead - leaving [DK] in the hands of Bond who rejoined on revival day - what happened is not clear, but there were talks of an imposter having been found. Though clan overcame this and increased roster size, by end of 2003 however DK was absorbed into the yet again revived [I]mmortal that would then be faced with a quite dead 2004.",

(Which is closer to a snail's pace really). The Forums have been updated and contain a passworded section. I still have a bit of tweaking to do to make it right. At present anyone can still read it just not post in it. But I'll have that fixed soon. (Hopefully)<br /><br />The Knight's page has been updated with the very latest information. New division/squad assignments have been made and some members have been promoted. We have lost a few and gained a few. The ranks have been condensed down to 2 divisions. I know that some feelings got hurt during the restructure, and I apologize for that. But something serious had to be done. DK has run so smoothly for so long, and i'm sorry that we hit a huge bump in the road, but that's the way it goes. Most clans don't even make it this far let alone do it as smoothly as we have. So let's all suck it up and drive on.<br /><br />We are back in a state of holding for new applicants. The Training Program is not quite yet underway. I still have a few details to flesh out on that before we can launch it. Once we have everything in place we will begin with the DX University.<br /><br />I realize that this latest transition is a large pill to swallow for all of you. However, if you will be patient and have a bit of faith in me all will work out for the best. DK will once again be on top. I have not so far steered any of you wrong in the past and I'm not about to start now. So trust me, we will overcome.","clan"]

                "backgroundStory" : ["","monoxide","Monoxide:","I think the first person to remember me when I joined was Rocketman. After that was probably 2Jiggy4u. Jiggy was always quite a bit better than me, but I think Rocketman was about the same level. I joined a game one day and he was sporting a tag, [DMI]. There were a couple others on the server, a was a little jealous. I played with them for a while, and eventually Hitman (not the Aussie) asked if I would like to join the clan. I knew they were a new bunch, but I did not realize until later that they had just been formed that day. Through email conversation with Hitman I learned of the roster he had managed to accumulate in one day: ADOYS, out4blood, Virtualbullzae, SilentSniper, CrimsonDragon, Merlin, Duke, Rocketman. I knew who Rocketman was, but who the hell were these other guys? DMI was to be a democratic clan. There was no leader, and there were no ranks, no seniority. Virtualbullzae was working on a website for the clan, and SilentSniper was hosting a server. I volunteered to help on the website, since I was a *cough* expert (hindsight: total noob). I decided to drop the spacemonkey name, and go with Monoxide, I had a smoking habit at the time so it seemed fitting. The first time I hopped into a server as Monoxide[DMI], I saw Jiggy sporting some [EIS] tag. I told him who I was, and he started laying it into me asking why I joined them, I could join EIS. While giving it some thought, some of my new teammates started joining the server. It quickly turned into an unofficial DMI vs EIS friendly battle. Seems like we were about equal. Afterwards I talked to Jiggy on MSN, and he admitted that DMI was better than his initial thoughts.<br /><br />We spent a lot of time in our own private server. For the most part we would cruise around big maps and just chat in game. Out of everybody in the clan I think I talked to Duke and Merlin the most. They lived close to me so we always joked about getting together (Duke and Merlin were/are close friends IRL). I started playing with the shotgun and sniper rifle only. One day Duke challenged me to a 1v1. I could not kill the bastard. He later told me it was because he was using augs, and proceeded to tell me what all of them did. I started using Speed, and Ballistic Protection. Duke, Merlin and I all seemed to be at the same skill level. ADOYS and Hitman were on the east coast, we never seemed to be online at the same time. None of the others ever played on public servers. I thought for sure we were the best in the clan, until the first time I actually had to play against ADOYS. You could unload 5 ammo crates into that dude and he would not die. Over time, other people started to think we were pretty good.<br /><br />Arouned August 2001 I was taking a trip to Monterey to see a friend who was doing work out there. My course took me right by Duke's house, so him, Merlin and I decided to meet up. It was no doubt...awkward. Both of them were entirely different than I had imagined, I'm sure they can say the same about me. This meeting brought the three of us pretty close together. It was almost like a clan within the clan.<br /><br />We managed to create a pretty heated rivalry with EIS. Come to find out most of them hated everybody in DMI except for me. Jiggy continued attempting to convince me I needed to join them. We tried to setup a real clan match with EIS, the turnout on both sides was utterly dissapointing. So much that I won't go into the results of the 3v3 and eventually 2v2 that ensued. It was pretty much even as I recall.<br /><br />A young kid going by DreamStation desperately wanted into DMI. His clan had just broken up, for the life of me I can't remember their name or tag. They were around during Yakuza and CYD times. A big controversy (what? drama in DX? no!!) errupted when some unkown person was seen running around PDX with a plasma rifle that shot at insane speeds. I didn't believe it until I saw it. DreamStation was talking to me on MSN one day telling me how easy it was for anybody to cheat in DX. He took me and a few DMIs to a private server and showed us the shottime command. He eventually confessed that it was him with the Plasma rifle, and that a lot of people knew about the command. Word got out that it was him, people were not happy. He became an outcast of DX.<br /><br />I guess I always had a hardon for DEA. I spent a lot of time on their minimalistic website, wondering if I'd ever be good enough to join them. If you ask me, I will still say Apoc was hands down the best player ever in DX. Even considering others in over the course of time, Messiah was really good, Merlin definitely became one of the best, and he would probably contend that VainGlory was always the best, but nobody ever dominated the game the way Apoc did when there were so many other good players around. Maybe I'm blinded though, ADOYS seemed to be able to get the upper hand on him. Vain apparently always did too, so much that Slicer tried to run him out of the game. I envied Apoc's style so much I decided to try to adopt it. I started playing as a cloaking speed tank. My skill level seemed to jump through the roof over night.<br /><br />One random night at 1AM or so I played against a fellow by the name of ClarkGriswald. There were maybe one or two other noobs on the server, it was pretty much just him and I 1v1. We encountered each other a few more times over the next few days, and seemed to dominate the servers at that time of night. I couldn't help but laugh my ass off every time I saw his name, thinking of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Eventually I started talking to him on AIM. I thought he was a new player, turns out he had been around as long as I had. He had a different handle for all of his playing styles, and I knew every single one of them, thinking they were all great individual players. The one I had seen him use the most in the past was c()()per. The one others know is TonyMontana. I suggested that he join DMI, in fact I pestered him about it for a few days. He said he was holding out for word from BC on whether or not they would let him into DEA. I guess ol Joe took too long getting back to him, and he decided to join us, which he later took hell for because Joe came to him saying he was fit for DEA. For whatever reason he decided to stick with us, for the remainder of our time as a clan. With ClarkGriswald on the roster, we were no doubt one of the best clans of the time. Through him I was able to start talking to people in DEA. I managed to somewhat befriend BC and slicer.<br /><br />My most memorable series of battles in DX came around this time. PDX was the server, Towers was the map. There were DEA, EIS, DMI, and a few freelancers. The general fight seemed to be outside on the ground. I managed to encounter Apoc in the office of the cental building. Words cannot explain the battles we had. It was a mental battle more than anything, both of us cloked with full augs, trying to use sounds and objects in the room to trick each other into uncloaking and firing a HE shell or tossing a lam in some direction, and then occasionally we would both go all out 1v1, only to cloak again and heal up. Eventually he killed me. I got a few quick kills and rushed back in there ASAP, sure enough, he was waiting. We did this at least five times. I don't know if I managed to kill him once. I asked him about it nearly a year later, he remembered it as well as I did.<br /><br />DMI had gotten too good to be true apparently. I guess ADOYS mopped the floor with slicer one too many times. Slicer went on a crusade telling everybody we cheated. I exchanged several emails with him. He made it seem like he believed what I was saying, and dropped the accusations, so I thought. Some guy by the name of recils (w31|2d h4x0|2 letters) approached hitman wanting to join DMI. Nobody had ever heard of him, he said he was old school, we were all far too trusting, and apparently flat out retarded for not noticing his name. We tried him out, he was really good. So we decided to let him in. The joke was on us, it was slicer. All he wanted to do was take a gander through our private forum. He found no dirt, and played the whole thing off to the community as acceptable. Most people seemed to side with him, saying we were far too good, and that we came up too quick as a clan. This, in essence, killed DMI. One by one our members wanted nothing to do with DX.<br /><br />All of us wanted to stick together as a group, so we took a stab at Tribes 2. That, is a whole story of its own, which I will not go into. After several months of playing Tribes, Merlin talked me into playing a game of DX. It didn't take me long to get hooked again. I was still pretty upset about the DMI thing, I felt I would be part of the clan forever. Merlin wanted to start a new clan. I hesitantly agreed with him, and decided to play as SecondHandSmoke for whatever reason. Jadesfire (who I tried, unsuccessfully, to court into joining DMI on more than one occasion) said she wanted to be a part of it, thus, Reactors was born."]

April 4 Skywalker says clan is formed but its already old news. Leader was giving up after competitive pressure but thanks to 2Jiggy he changed mind and attempted to format clan into DU Elite, DU Advanced, DU Beginners subclans, each with their own leaders, but seems the clan split by mid April 2001 and turned into [GDX] in a month. Best players of [DU] are leaving for Lightning's [USA] clan around April 28, SilentFire threatened those who left. Kaiser is laughing about DU falling apart after a month. c22 forums have updates on [DU] death already 28th.",

We will soon rectify ourselves and prove him wrong. If the joining is succesful we will have a server and be able to challenge some clans for we have enough power to do so.

Oh and each section will have a leader. I will work on calssifying you into categories soon. Oh and also I am not quiiting the clan.

A tip here is to use phpMyAdmin.<br />* Edit the source files so that the names of the databases are correct.<br />* Edit the source files so that you can use your own design.<br /><br />NOTICE:<br />* I can not provide any support, neither installation (you will get further instructions if you contact me for the source) or administration.<br />* I can not help you to learn php or mysql, if you don't know these two, you should start with plain html instead Wink.<br /><br />Just thought that I could point this out, so there won't be any misunderstandings Wink. As I stated above, if you felt that anything of this was confusing or anything similar, you should use ordinary html or a web page editor instead.<br /><br />(If you wondered why I built a system as advanced as this one, it was because I didn't want to edit the pages manually and remake the design quite often Razz.

        "description" : "Sixth year non-MTL BTDM clan of largely Spanish speaking beginners, it accumulated a huge number of members and was close with another very similar clan DIOS. They were still accepting wars in 2013 it seems, so mightve died with game. {E.d.H2} EdH Second Team merged into main EdH somepoint. This clan created and maintained a scene of its own in DXMP, providing non-MTL servers for those who couldnt enter MTL servers, and hosting Basic game types modded for infinite bio which appealed to young beginners more. Its possible the clan somehow had some Adv match at some point but it was never their focus and the statistics of this group should contribute towards Basic that they maintained in the community.",

We also consider Melandri to be a founder as he was the first member to join E.d.H shortly after its creation. The clan started during an uncertain time in DXMP's history. There were a large number of players who cheated and tried to bring the game down but instead of surrendering to them, we fought on and won the battle! Initially, WarWolf wanted the clan to be for Spanish players only. After many discussions it was obvious that we had many friends who weren't Spanish but wanted to join, therefore E.d.H became an International clan."]

I personally haven't seen GoD playing but I have heard that he is damn good. The fifth member is certain to be MastaPopo. Cheeze has vastly improved recently and should be on form for the match. The sixth member is not sure yet, there is three people fighting to get it. I haven't ever liked the idea that clan members have to fight against each other in these kind of situations, but it has to be done.<br /><br />ThugNation's second clan match. The first one was against S and that was a big flop. TN lost very badly, though they didn't have their best player, only 3 of TN elite members were in the game including TicTacToad and semisonic. This time ThugNation will be more prepared. TicTacToad has arranged the game so that everyone there will be from TN elite.

We left one of the best clans in DXMP at that time, the [A]lliance to form our own clan, it seems we had the same intentions as many other clan members because in that same week approximately seven members left the [A]lliance too.<br /><br />At first, [eN]igma was going to be a Halo MP only clan, but over time we realised that there was not much to lose in creating a DXMP division. We now have a Halo Clan which has still not got off to a very good start, and a DXMP one which seems to be thriving.<br /><br />From the beginning Splitter and I hoped that [eN]igma would rely more upon their tactics as opposed to their skill. Therefore frequent trainings are held and strategy discussions are commonplace in the private forums.<br /><br />To my suprise many well known players were shocked to hear of our departure from the [A]lliance to set up our own clan, and it was nice to know that we gained a small amount of respect in our nine months or so of playing DXMP.<br /><br />Splitter and I started playing DXMP at the same time, it was after our friend 'Xuir' (a.k.a. Shogun) said he had joined an online clan - |ALPHA|. At first, he kicked our asses, but ever since then Splitter and I have been playing together and prove to be a rather difficult opponent (to some people :P).<br /><br />Within a few days of opening we had four or five members asking to join, only one of which made the grade - ---[eN]Fusion---. The trial we ran for this player was an outstanding game and we are very lucky to have him with us.<br /><br />Two weeks or so later we held an 'all-nighter' and that too was successful. Many a match was fought and phenominal scores were achienved all round.<br /><br />That's a quick overview of the founding and history behind [En]igma, and all i can be bothered writing at this moment in time :P<br /><br />Update (3/12/04)<br /><br />Now, almost half a year on we are beginning to get a good reputation. We aren't getting as many trials now but our playing quality is increasing and we are getting more respect as a clan.<br /><br />With one of our players still out of action we havent played any wars as of yet. Depsite the requests we have had. But, in the near future we have wars up against [DF], [DXR], and [A]. Looks like a jam-packed xmas for eNigma.<br /><br />A huge site update meant new additions to the 'services' eNigma provide, I have added, with the help of Splitter and Fusion a section named Intel - this section should provide players new to Deus Ex Multiplayer with suitable resources which provides them with information on useful game strategies and user.ini modding.<br /><br />The section, should also include demorecs to explain those little tricks in the game, such as LAM climbing and other 'eastereggs'."]

Because of this war and who disagreements over who was going to fight in it, the merged clans disbanded and a new clan was borne. Regretfully  some friendships were damaged.  But, I hope to have this war as soon as we have sorted out our members. I'm not letting DF off the hook that easily!<br /><br />Well that went well LOL - EóD+¥ has dispanded and gone there seperate ways.  EóD has with regrets lost some of it's long time members most of all GreatDane. Who will be missed from the clan. But up to now most of EóD have gone to a new clan. Formed by yes, u guessed it  - by me.  I'm not to sure what's happened to ¥ but some of their players have stayed with the new clan, not sure how many, I will keep u posted.<br /><br />And  so a new clan is borne Mén óf Hónóúr {MóH} for now.  It will be led by me jcmental, u can go and see the other members in the members list (left).  Or if u feel u'r good enough u can apply to join by clicking on the wanna join link (left).","clan"]

Adding extra 1-2 members over months the leader - who really seemed to love this game and preferred it over the hugely popular Counter Strike - seemed to seriously struggle with making connections in the community, while his members attempted to help. Slicer has marked this n/a and the mystery surrounding the name attracted more attention from other clans than probably any other advertising effort from this group, it turns out however that the leader was just feeling ashamed of the initial cringey name and preferred the clan to go without a name entirely. Site is opened with intro on September and by mid-October still had 2 Australian members only. Clan later fought [T] over tag and after a loss seemed content to change theirs but [T] rebranded instead, possibly feeling bad about taking tag from an older clan. Clan eventually added one player from UK and much later one player from Mexico or thereabouts, which wouldve made coordinating anything simply impossible.",

This is due to firstly the number of things to update on, the computer problems i have been having (got Athlon 1600+ now :), learning basic mapping and coding (a mod may be in production soon) and experimenting with other games due to the slowly dieing DXMP community. Myself and [FBF]AzN have been in Counter-Strike for the last week or two and have not found it anywhere near as ammusing a DXMP. The DXMP community in my opinion is one of the most friendly in the gaming world. While playing people always find time to talk and catch up but also have fun in shooting the living crap out of their peers. Although above i mentioned that the DX community is 'slowly dieing', I and the [FBF] Clan will be there 'till the very end, whenever that happens to be. There will be more vast updates during the month including possibly a new design, downloads will be added and more info on the mod.<br /><br />By the way we are still recruiting to anyone who's intrested.

As the old founders - who both seem to be part of the German and perhaps Berlin underground gothic and industrial scene - were becoming more inactive, a new generation of young and active members formed a lively society there with mapping and modding efforts spanning several gametypes but often not having much to do with classic gametypes. The Nobody brought some friendly German order to the clan, ChineseDemocracy created and ported some of the best custom maps that were actually playable, and the many other members contributed with skill, organizatory initiative, or playtime, to make sure the mod servers were played in at all. According to some calculations its some 16 or so members who speak German. Hasharin also lists FGSn tag but not clear if its related - one'd imagine so. By 2007 FGS founders Roi and Icho were no longer active and new members filled the void as well as began to convert FGS into a war-capable clan.",

A clan certainly born out of an unpatched vulnerability in the game and harkening back to the [cdp] days of lean sploits, a whole growing society of young players taught to cheat by one math teacher in France is taking it to a next level, although that already applies to later [NKz] nucleus around Phantom. Seems Phantom left [NKz] to make this clan late October 2012. Hasharin also lists an First Person Shooter clan, its either this one or some less relevant separate FPS.

The name of the clan means; We Fight Under Extreme Limits. Simple as that! ScoobyDoo[TCNdk] is the website designer for this website and the owner of the forums. Any problems with the website or forums, contact her!<br /><br />This clan has no ranks or favourite members(know what I mean?). Basically we are all equal. If we have to make a decidion we have a clan discussion and a vote, we may come to public vote, too. We have set up some rules for our server and clan that will be applied too! We are going to pick up the active players with skill, loyalty and trust. We are currently recruiting so if your interested in joining us, pop around to the 'Join Us' Forums and make a topic!<br /><br />If we become a successful clan, make it through all the ups and downs, don't get completly destroyed by other clans and avoid arguments we will hopfully last and make our way to Deus Ex2. Neo[FUEL] is our top map maker in [FUEL]. You can download his maps from the website.<br /><br />Our aim is to be a successful clan and make it to Deus Ex2 with all our top-skill members! "]

Spawn Killing is when a player enters a spawn room/area and kills the player who has just spawned and has no weapons. If the player picks up a weapon and attacks you, you may attack back. But don't kill anyone else in the spawn room/area, unless they shoot at you.<br /><br />If you are caught Spawn Killing then you will be kicked from the server! If you come back to the server and continue to Spawn Kill then you will be banned from the server!</li><li> · Team Killing<br /><br />Like other servers Team Killing is NOT allowed. Team Killing is when a player from your team kills you, on purpose. If the player continues to Team Kill you or any other team mates please contact the host of the server.<br /><br />If you are caught Team Killing then you will be kicked from the server! If you come back to the server and continue to Team Kill then you will be banned from the server!</li><li> · Bug Abuse/Cheats<br /><br />You can't! Need I say more? If you know a bug or a cheat that can by-pass the new MTL mod please contact ScoobyDoo[TCNdk].</li><li>  · Spawn Camping<br /><br />Completly NOT allowed! Spawn Camping is when a player stands outside the spawn room and kills the enemy the instant they come out of the spawn room door. You must let the player have a chance to get out of the spawn room door. This can be mistaken as Spawn Killing. After a while this is very very annoying.<br /><br />If you are caught Spawn Camping then you will be kicked from the server! If you come back to the server and continue to Spawn Camp then you will be banned from the server!</li><li> · Abusive Language<br /><br />This will not be tolerated at all!<br /><br />If you continue to use Abusive Language then you will be kicked from the server! If you come back to the server and continue to use Abusive Language then you will be banned from the server!</li><br /><br />Server List #<br />[FUEL] SERVER #1 - Hosted by Apoc[FUEL]!<br />[FUEL] SERVER #2 - Hosted by Neo[FUEL]!<br />[FUEL] SERVER #3 - Hosted by Morpheus[FUEL]!"]

GATO was formed after the completion of the original game after we blew up Bobby in the big explosion. For more go to Story.<br /><br />After completion of the game, (blowing the hell out of bobby) the remaining NSF members formed an allegiance with the remaining UNATCO members thus forming GATO the most elite group ever.  At the head of this group is Sam Carter he has a lot more experience than one might think.<br /><br />GATO's role was to protect the entire planet from terrorist organisations such as the recently formed Real NSF.  The headquarters of GATO are based on a remote island of the shore of England. This complex has only one building as the rest of the base is situated deep underground making it virtually impenetrable.  JC is currently at this base undergoing re-augmentation after his original augs where permanently damaged in the massive EP explosion (Electro Plasmatic).<br /><br />Unfortunately as JC was preparing to undergo re-augmentation the HQ was suddenly attacked by Real NSF troops.   This infiltration must have been coordinated from within.  JC finds himself with no augs preparing to take on a small force of well armed troops with excellent experience.  At least this time he's sure of what he's fighting for.<br /><br />We are currently are making a series of maps to go along with this story line and hope to make them available for downloading soon."]

Now we're off again, I just hope he'll be online again sooner. I would also like to say why there is little going on here. This is because we don't have fixed training times like other clans. We meet in ICQ and if several people are online and want to gamble then we gamble. Another point is that we don't do clan wars against AMI like this and since there are no German clans, there are no clan wars.<br />I hope we can build our ELITE team again now that Corp is back *GG*. Back when we were still doing DEMI, Agent Corp and I were the best and pulled everyone off :-) then Corp disappeared :-( and Agent and I took down the other bums on our own :-) Well let's see we have to get our Elite Expand team. Denton, for example, has a lot of kills but usually just as many deaths. and I haven't seen Nomi play yet. AFUFO hasn't played for a long time and what BloodyDeamon is doing is a mystery to me too. If they played with us 4 times more often then they could soon be among the ELITE. Well, first we'll wait and see how good Corp is still :-)<br /><br />One more thing: Trial members are no longer just members or non-members who need that shitty trial shit :-)","clan"]

First it only worked half the time, then it stopped working at all and now it only says COUNTER OFFLINE. :-(<br />Well and then there is the || www.gcpro.de | Server that's completely crazy. First he was off for a while, then over the weekend it was just Smuggler and now he's completely gone again. This is really disgusting.<br /><br />But now something completely different. Since the MI Clan is apparently DEAD, I deleted the LINK. HAHA NOW HOLD UP! There is now a 2nd German Deus Ex clan! Brand new since May 24th, 2001. Hey no joke guys! You can find the link there on the left *LOL*.

        "description" : "A long-enduring clan from the summer of the third year, this older Counter Strike clan formed its DXMP wing on the initiative of its member Reclaimer the same summer that Void appeared out of Evo and DWK merge, not long after after GODZ. Slowly settling into the niche that JTB and the following DD and Evo had carved out known as zero-augs, the clan was already attracting veterans of all walks by early 2005, with the notable additions in shape of Sinner, JJBomber, then the closing [3] brought ex-members GoTTi, StealthMonk to the fold. Following years saw American playerbase in DXMP diminish, forcing members to play with unacceptable pings in public games, and 2007 server attacks were the final nail in the coffin that brought about clan closure as leader moved to [T] clan. It wasnt long until HK was back once more, this time growing its roster with the likes of HeY, TBD, Labtec, and by 2012 also listed Ricci and yet another triad Kale, all interested in challenging A!B that housed every other veteran auger. Clan appeared to conduct its challenges in a savvy enough manner to stack up a flawless record up until newly emerged clans either used Triad style re-interpretation of a lost war, or organized wars on clan's behalf without leader's direct involvement. Roster contains lot of aliases and unknown names to DXMP making it hard to count exact size in DXMP, currently some are marked as generic id until further clarifications.",

                "backgroundStory" : ["2024-03-28","reclaimer","Reclaimer:","The first players to wear the tag in DX were me and a friend of mine who played for HK in other games first. That was around summer 2003. It was after GODZ tho, that much I can recall. I seem to remember 2003 was when 0 augs took off first in JTB and Void servers and then finally with NoChanc's top of the list server. My friend back then played as Warrior23 and we were still pretty new and only really played 0 aug for the first year or so. By 2004 HK had more players coming from CounterStrike and UT coming to check out DXMP. That's also the year we got our forums set up.<br /><br />By 2005 HK was imo the top 0 aug clan in the US next to CG, Void, DWK, nMe and DCSB. Although we never did get to war those guys since by then nMe, Void and DWK were less organized, DCSB was mostly Euro. We talked about matching with CG but in the meantime went up against smaller clans like SoF and [Z] and [PNK]. <br /><br />The only reason I say we were good is cuz every time I or any other HK tag entered a US match we always dominated. And we had a 0 aug server back then, (HK)Baltaron's server based in Phoenix, Arizona. That was the only time I ever pinged below 80 in DXMP and I was able to beat all the tough players back then there including Grubby and a lot of the [IO] guys we were rivals with. Which reminds me we warred [IO] a couple times.<br />Baltaron also hosted our maps back when we even made those. Idk how many of them ever got saved in the DX Alpha archive unfortunately.<br /><br />This was 2005 still. In 05 him (Baltaron) and Ricci were the top players in the west. Flaw, Ricci, JJ, and DdM. Then in 0 augs there were others like me and CloudStrike and several HK's. Cajun and JACKTHERIPPER from [BTJ]. Dillinger and Malachai. <br /><br />Yea Sinner was in [HK] he played with us against [IO] and [SoF] and some other 0 aug clans. Oh I just remember 2005 was also when Gotti and Stealth Monk joined us. The first Triads to join. There was also Scarface, the American one who started Crazy 88's. He was from Oregon.<br /><br />Well we played a lot together and we were all cool with each other for the most part too so. We had good games and we were all good players. I think I played a lot with Gaz, Trauma, Kale and JJBOMBER in augs. I barely played augs before 2005. It was less popular than 0 aug and there were less aug servers. In 2006 I got decent at augs finally and stopped using active/deactivate all. <br /><br />I think 06 might have been when we started recruiting good Euro auggers like TBD and HeY. At some point we also recruited ScienceNerd, all three of those guys fresh from one of Shifter's newest clans Shen al'Calhar. 2006 might have been when Deja Vu dossed all the servers and the only American aug server was DrunKard's BTDM and the only clans we had to fight that weren't Euro based were EDH and DIOS. So activity slowed down in DXMP for a lot of American players. Cuz of some douchebag in Europe.<br /><br />(on JJBomber) Yea he played aliased as (HK)Gohan as a nod to [TCN]Goku.<br /><br />Then in 2006 when USA communities were pretty much gone [T] came back with their server hosted by JackOff called [T]ranscendation. That was when I really played ATDM more than BTDM for the first time. This was like late 2006 early 07. That was also when Flaw became the top USA player of all time. I think HK was still around during that time in other games and a little in DXMP so I joined [T] so I could play in some matches with Flaw and Vort and some other old players that I knew from back in the day.<br /><br />(on Soviet celebrating HK death) lmao<br />That dude was DXMP's biggest player hater next to Darko<br /><br />Anyways yea I think in 07 I was playing with [T] and having like inter clan scrimmages with and vs Flaw and Spaz and Shaun etc. Until the drama in their clan happened. Probably was back in HK by the end of 07 or early 08. Flaw and [T] were less active as well by then or rather Flaw was aliasing, he had also join [3] along with GrimRaper. <br /><br />But I think at that time he played mostly with no tags and just player aliased or used a random pseudonym like Messiah and Ricci and I used to do.<br /><br />By 2009 I was definitely back with HK and we were warring Sike's clan [B] and some others at the time, I'm pretty sure somebody recruited HeY to HK around 08/09.<br /><br />By 2010 the only Amereican servers that weren't Karky's party server or some funline or RPG server was the TAC servers hosted by LTK and then MIRK. So prtetty much the only way for Americans to play competetively by the turn of the decade was in infite bio servers with clyzm and tnag/altfire weapons.<br /><br />Also I can't remember if HK ever had a scroller logo on the bottom of some clan sites, I vaguely remember there being one that Shifter made. <br /><br />Well others founded HK in Counstrike but I founded the DXMP division. I saw all sorts of tags, originally it was (HK) but I saw others do [HK], {HK} and even /HK\\ and .:HK:. lmao<br />hell even hk. or .hk<br /><br />(on kool tags) I think it died off when cross play became big<br />console players use x's instead<br /><br />I think by 2011/12 I was barely playing. Only finding occasional games in TAC. Then I heard back from some Euro HK vets who were still getting regular games in ATDM servers that were too laggy for me and they were organizing some wars. That was around the time Kale and Ricci came into the fold I think <br /><br />I think Bambi hosted a USA ATDM server and that was where I got to play a lot with Ricci and Kale, great matches. The best 1v1's I ever had since my matches vs Flaw and Gaz in 2006<br /><br />(on a THC spy getting recruited) Yea that was Bambi's fault. He vouched for him and said he was a personal friend. HK infiltrated a few clans too but it was really only to keep an eye on their private boards to see if they were cheating. We were probably not the only ones to do this."]

Our clan intends to project itself upon the community as the classic shooter team, embracing all traditional and competition-level gaming beliefs and rules. This means that cheating, whining, and generally obnoxious behaviour does not have a place in our society that is built upon the joy for the game and a pride in our increasing abilities, growing experience.<br /><br />There is a beauty in the perfection of every execution, and fun in battling a worthy adversary; and this is what the Hivemind intends to show to its new members and the surrounding community. This is why we en courage growth in both skill- and personal level, accepting new members without excessive scrutiny.<br /><br />Naturally, we focus on anything a normal clan would: whether it is winning clan wars or enjoying private skrims; but it all has the same equal attention, as growing in numbers or planning clan maps and other projects does -- and that, for the benefit of the DXMP community that we are a proud part of."]

                "backgroundStory" : ["","ken","Ken:","My last DXMP clan during its active days, I tried to lead it as we had led [REN] half a decade earlier, except this time with a much higher focus on auged gameplay which I wanted every member to learn and practice. Because some players first learned to aug in this clan it likely deserves B tier for it as well - training programme was very much a thing in the clan since experienced players were rare to recruit, but in general my goal was to rapidly boost them into at least advanced level of play by leveraging my experience from a decade of activity in the competitive scene.<br /><br />I made this clan after I became active in DXMP again and the disagreements over speedhacking in server led me to quit THC late 2012. Because I had led all previous clans with some more grounded leader figure supporting me, I decided on starting the clan up with some random guy I had seen a few times in zero aug server. Named Unknown he was from UK and for a clearly more amateur player he got such amazing shots that I decided to eventually kick him from the clan he helped found - it got to a point where it was either that or that I quit myself and watch the concept I had created turn into nothing - in hindsight I blame myself for overloading my partner with stress from all sorts of stories of past top tier matches, and while cute in a way, creating things with *ahem* unknown people probably doesnt lead to a much different outcome anyway.<br /><br />A separate problem our clan faced was lack of players: virtually impossible to recruit augers unless I somehow leveraged decade old connections, majority would end up in A!B, some in HK, maybe even THC, meanwhile I had to have winning chances in something so I made sure it was my forte zero-aug first. Even zero-aug recruitment was a nightmare at that point, most available players were beginners who were taught to cheat by Phantom in his various clans like NKz and FPS. I would occasionally gain help from old friends from REN like Clix, now playing with Chinese ping, or get lucky with the recruiting of a truly OG Norwegian zero-auger CaS who in addition to skilled play also helped us fund the server, yet majority of clan activity would revolve around teaching newer players how to play top tier zero-augs and competitive ATDM without hacking.<br /><br />Eventually our fairly large group reached a level where due to lack of match experience I think we would've still lost in ATDM against contemporary HK and THC top guns, not to mention A!B, yet in 0aug I don't think any of them were an issue. There was some drama about our clan hosting auged server in Europe where THC was attempting to gain center stage, but unlike there we didn't allow visible cheating in ours. Decade earlier Messiah would've deleted any mention of THC even existing on his site on grounds of them harboring cheaters, exactly as he had already done with another clan.<br /><br />At some point I picked up another player related to Phantom's circle called DaniSaggenza who quickly became the core member I'd frequently train with to keep skill up. He already showed some leadership skills himself, and players started to join who I could tell were part of his clique, among them his then-gf, and a couple members got in only because they were his friends. At some point we fell out as I became suspicious of his play style and that led to his friends quitting to form their own clan. That was already later into the last year of DXMP and technically the official serverlist was already dead for a few months. Overwhelmed by the situation where there was no limit to how fast you can shoot your guns, and with every player potentially shooting at different speeds, it felt like a good idea to end the game and the clan with the year 2014."]

All your feedback is most welcome and we hope you enjoy the games in our server.<br /><br />We now have a paid, quality server up in the serverlist, and another fast-speed home server available for various testing purposes. To accommodate best the wishes of our members, the server has been set to standard Zero-Augs, and is intended to stay that way for a good while. Our goal with that server is to reshape the lackluster 0aug scene by finally providing a good, enduring set of highest quality available gaming maps best suited for exactly that game type. Additionally, our admin and mod presence is planned to safeguard our server in various time-zones, and we intend to politely escort out any spammers and other troublemakers or idiots -- a good boot-kick in the behind seems like a good medicine!<br />Additional web page for Server has been made viewable for the public and a new forum board has been created to best communicate with our players.<br />Since last update several trainees have been recruited, and other plans, relevant to our member base, are in the works. Now Hivemind can boast with 12 members and 4 trainees. Adjusting activity times needs a bit of work, but to compensate for the lack of rivalling clans and groups we have come up with the idea of implementing squads within our clan. Those named squads will not only have matches between them, but will also be available for other clans to challenge individually! This feature will hopefully be fully implemented sometime this month. Additional plans are set to boost activity in original DXMP game types by encouraging progression in that direction. After all, mega kills will keep our guys entertained for only so long<br /><br />With all the best wishes,","clan"]

Merlin was downright post-menstrual. I can understand the frustrations and I apologize, on behalf of CG, for causing a situation in which you had to leave the game. I wish I could offer guarantees that that would never happen again. We simply didn't have enough people signed up to serve as backups. no one was available at the time. In the future, I hope that all CG members will make every effort to be on MSN and available at match times should someone not show. As I've said privately to a few of your members, you gave us a great match. Not much a challenge for you, but it was fun, we got a few good licks in, and realized how much we have yet to learn. My vote for Match MVP: Merlin...... he was there consistently when I had one of you guys almost killed, and he nailed me good. Merlin is the best player I have seen in DXMP in terms of coming in to support a fallen team member. Great job, Merl! And all of I, very well played. I am also proud of the CG guys who played. you stuck with it. And that is equally admirable. Lesser men -- whether by fear or wounded ego -- would have fled the scene.

Leader had already been part of and founded multiple clans in the preceeding months, founding this concept with an unknown player called SoulZ and later finding stable enough co-leaders to maintain clan for about a year. Then merged with [BK] to form [D]ivine in an attempt to create a supergroup, which turned out to be short-lived. Created 'new [I] swf' early April 3, presumably after [D] death, built up activity once again throughout 2003 and then handed clan over to DXA and DEV leader Eagle with the arrival of 2004. Although Merlin was making another comeback with November 2004 the clan was reported dead again in December. Roster is fairly low resolution and can be improved, clan will be revisited later to bring you forum posts and better information.",

On his third attempt to start a successful clan, Merlin found hope in a player named SoulZ. Who exactly SoulZ was is unknown to date. They contemplated names for the clan and ended up deciding on the name [I]mmortal. Merlin then asked DrDuke who was another DMI fallout to help lead the clan. Recruiting for the clan started immediately. The first recruit was a newbie that went by the name [Khans]Gaz. Gaz began training with Merlin and became a great player. More recruits followed Gaz followed by more recruits. The clan was quite successful at this point, being labeled one of the best clans in DXMP. By this time, there was no sign of Soulz anywhere. After about 15 e-mail attempts, SoulZ was labeled MIA and kicked out of [I].<br />Shortly thereafter, Problems between [I] and [R] were escalated by bannings from the [R] server. Conflicts and tension was in a great amount between the two clans...until the found their common goal.... Dethrone DEA. DrDuke, Merlin, and MERC set out to find a way to dethrone DEA. Duke came up with the idea that in order to take their power away, We would need to change the Ev1.net DM server, to AdvTeam. "]

Good luck to him.<br /><br />2)After a few stutte steps, Shogun has now been promoted amongst the ranks of [I] and has taken the postition as a leader. He will be in charge of setting up practices, recruit tests, and clan matches. Congrats to Shogun. BTW, to any of you who think this was done to get Shogun to stay with us, you are wrong. THis was done for 3 reasons:<br />a) I need help running the clan with how busy ive been lately.<br />b) Shogun has been with us for quite sometime and has always has his eye out for the clan and its best interests.<br />c) To show Shogun how much he means to me and the clan.<br />Thanks for hanging in there Gun...<br /><br />3) ChemicalAGENT has left DX for bigger and better things. School and $$$. Good luck to you man. You were always fun to play with and talk to. Keep in touch.<br /><br />4) A few players are interested in joining the ranks of [I]. Hang in there.... we are slow to test as most of us have jobs and get quite caught up at work. Monkee got antsy and joined [3].... proves how much he really wanted to join [I]. Among the players that would like to join are names such as Jaster and Robo. If i forgot someone, dont take it personnally.<br /><br />5) @ new members in the past few weeks that i may have posted about before but damn news page got F*cked up.

Real Names: Mick Axje, Rollo Snook, Kothar, (The Dutch Squad lol) Dont know MasterShadow.<br />2. We have found that we worked well together in battle and forums. I can't speak for others but FGS was a mapper's dream and on my wishlist to join, but I wanted better screenshots before I applied, because I have seen 98 from Toss.<br />3. We try to respect all people at all times.<br />4. Demo: I'm working on it, fixing my engine or finding someone who has demo'd us.<br /><br />I have informed all IA, but I can only reccomend DutchRisk, Kothar and Mastershadow and SpiritVII, because others I have not seen fight etc, not to say others aren't good. (Spirit does not really have time to fight much, he is a mapper and modder from another game who is learning Unreal mapping, but you can see how good his work is, by looking at DXMP_Syndicate_Beta0 in GODZ fileshare). All improve at a rapid speed. And I guess I would like to include myself in the application.<br /><br />I have some screenshots, if you are looking and my score is bottom, that means there is another IA member's top score at the top of the picture in green letters, not yellow.<br /><br />These first two are Dutch Risk Image Image<br />One of mine Image<br />One of Mastershadow's Image<br />Some of mine Image Image Image <br /><br />Reaction wrote: Its a group application ?<br /><br />ShadowRunner:  It allows me not to feel bad about accepting leadership and then leaving my loyal troops behind. IA had a little internal war between people who went to their own forums and those who didn't. It was embarassing to be challenged by clans and not be able to tell them when we could fight.<br />One of Yago's Image<br /><br />(To) Ichotolot: Spirit has been contacted. I just wait. He does actually fight. He was DXMP 3 years ago but went other games, now he's back. I played Cmd with him and I thought he was good. He wasn't dying. These are further explanations to our wanting to apply.<br /><br />Ichotolot and Xikron help ALL players, from newb to even me : :shock: . I have learned so much from FGS, and the importance of forums and visiting others and hosting nice sites. Xikron and Toss and Ooom and others I know well and are fautless players of the decent variety lol. They didn't pay me to say that. I have never seen FGS lower themselves or 'comment' or over-use the infolink. For me that is really important that they kill more than talk... Their forums make up for the 'radio silence' in the server. Their rules are the best of any clan, usually clan rules are long, but FGS rules are simple. One sentence = Respect ALL players. That's all you need...and a brain...and a heart. Their website is the best clan website I have ever seen. [A]Clan is too big. EDIT<br /><br />I only wish [A]Nobody would join DXMS and FGS... :lol: Hmm :wink: :lol: They are one of the four most important file sites in DX. FGS has a MTL server list on it's website 8) FGS has 4 servers with a mod that forces you to get better at sniping heads while moving at the same time. 8) FGS are uber-kool 8) 8) 8) FGS are quality 8) I will get seriously nice pings on their servers. :lol: I get 70 ping on the Wunderland II 32-bit server You will get even better. :lol: FGS are professional :lol: Ichotolot helped my mapping and gave me valuable server time so I could see if my betas worked or not. Low gravity is a MUST for map testing because you see bugs from the air and access areas you might not even know about, if there was no lighting there. FGS have a great music resource on their website and the clan is really alive and kicking and there is always a new map, track, laugh etc at FGS. THEY ARE MY FRIENDS!!! "]

Its possible this entry has multiple [J] clans fused into one, with 2006 [J] representing some kind of [T] side-venture until main clan got in gear with 2007, and 2009 [J] being a distinct new group by some more competitive Latino scene augers of Advanced experience.

October 2002 clan went through management changes and was losing players, some moving to Counter Strike. [OAK] leader ShadowmasterTheOne proceeds to merge JTB OAK and some minor clans into a new large clan [TGU]. Later years [JTB]_Mental remained the only regular to wear the tag, and in 2007 [JTB]Aviator[TLR] is seen organizing reunion matches, attempting alliance with [CG] and announcing the [JTB] clan. February 2008 Imperial representing the clan challenged [RTK] for 3v3, so the revival had gained some success. This clan sprouted a Low-Grav subdivision called {DWK} that with its distinct leaders and large roster has its own entry, but used JTB forums much like another JTB-related tag formation [TLR] did.",

Food shopping!!!!!' Hehehe. I made that one up earlier. If your joke is crap, I'll most probably accept you anyway.<br /><br />MEMBER INFO: I am supremely wonderful and therefore deserve lots of praise and reverence. If any of you join a game with me (KingHerrod) playing, I want you to type: 'Chips and Cheese please Mr. Herrod' and I will (probably) type: 'Oooo… Bums on toast please' and that means that I have acknowledged that there is one o my brethren there and stuff.<br /><br />KingHerrod does not discriminate against purple monkeys ever, and the recent court case against him involving Bert the Purple Monkey is actually totally farcical, and I doubt you've heard of it. That's probably because it doesn't exist. I'm getting an oz. though, so surely some children are needed???"]

We are called Lithium and are based from a former clan called From The Ashes or [FTA]. The leaders, GambitX and I, noticed some conflicts within this clan so we decided to try and revive what was left into this new clan. This new clan has new rules, new tatics for recruitment and is also a 'friendly one'.<br /><br />We have a little slogan for this clan, 'Friendship is Our Advantage'. What this is saying is that by having a sense of community and strong bonds, we can do anything. By building a clan on friendship almost anything is possible. We look forward to making new friends and becoming a strong force here in Deus Ex.<br /><br />Recruitment: Look for GambitX or Storm for a recruitment trial. It will be a one on one contest and if you can prove yourself you then are in the clan. If not we are willing to take time out to train you till you improve. You will not be part of the clan in that time period but afterward you are welcome too.<br /><br />Clan Battles: Just come to our site, tell us how many guys, augs or not, any other things we should know and wait for a reply from the leaders.<br /><br />If you wish to take part in a clan such as this, be sure to look for us on many servers. Best of luck to you all.<br /><br />- Storm and GambitX"]

We had just gotten off the ground when the Founder of [TS], Storm, was informed of family trouble and so he was busy (and therefor unable to run the clan). So GambitX started a second clan; [FTA] From the Ashes.<br /><br />[FTA] was just a placeholder in the hopes that Storm would eventually come back. However, it was also designed for permanency in the event that Storm was unable to join us. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. Storm rejoined and helped get our clan together. But internal conflicts forced us to start from scratch.<br /><br />So here we are: Clan Lithium. We have new rules, new strategies, new friends.

However the forums are active, and im happy to keep them as a community<br />http://licensetokillclan.forumotion.net/<br />The servers are still there untagged. (no we wont be getting rid of them so easlly :P ). And none of the members have left dx. The forums are still healthy. And me and the other admins/founders happy to keep them a healthy community as long as we can. I would like to thank everyone who supported us during our short time in dx.

Somehow I ended up chatting with {EoD} leader GreatDane and in spite of decade age difference we really got along well, so somehow the idea of merging into {EoD} came about. While initially it looked like the older clan simply absorbed us, we started discussing new tag to symbolize merge and where to take it from there - but for one or other reason I didn't feel at home there and left, dumping my roster into {EoD} and going solo.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly having more players led to more chaos in the clan and it appears clan had problems picking who should fight in a planned war, essentially crashing over the organizatory difficulties of it. Previous core member, an older UK retiree - with a teen son who rarely played - quickly formed a new, similar clan, which most likely was the logical culmination of a merge anyway.<br /><br />{MoH} would've probably worked out but my solo adventures soon led me to want to build a next cool clan, and this time I did it with the stable core leader of EoD and MoH groups, my now-friend Rene from Denmark aka the already mentioned GreatDane. He brought stability to my new [NEM] clan we built together before 2005 rolled in, and thus {MoH} lost that stability and JCDenton couldn't manage the clan alone, letting it die over the turn of year.<br /><br /> Well he brought enough stability that my attention span now doubled, reaching a whopping 3 months, and would even be doubled soon when we revive NEM second half of the year. JCMental however quickly banned me from his server as soon as he noticed me enter there.<br /><br />Its worth noting that I did try to poach couple of my old friends from {MoH} which is an unethical move, but as they concerned some of my key compatriots Laurens and Sidewinder I felt its none of JC's business whether I discuss it with my friends or not. I do believe my friends were initially loyal to the clan and only later made the move."]

It is quite possible the clan does not have tag at all and is not actually ever represented in DXMP, in spite of being listed as a DXMP clan. Clan seems to fight their matches on IRC, and for these reasons has been moved from Aug category into Mod category. Pretty much nothing on their website makes any sense. I would speculate that most likely it is an SP player who couldn't handle MP competitive pressure and created a parody of it, listing it in the main DXMP clanlist of the time as a troll; the clan may be related to one of the Australian players in the community - maybe Eagle or someone like him.",

No. The same can be said for LANarama. While it did have servers, computers, FinnyB (essential ingredient to any LAN), and wankers who play nothing but CS, was it a LAN? NO.<br /><br />Let's face it. Sootydog's little brother was the only thing that died more times than the power at the LAN.<br />On a brighter note, it was my most successful LAN to date. I only died about 10 times during the entire LAN, So I must be a LAN Master. Bring it on MC Hawking.<br /><br />Now at the last LAN, there were a few power cuts and there were over 100 people there. This suggested that the system at times was struggling with the power demand. Yet at LANarama, there were over 130 people running off double the power supply. Now forgive me if I'm wrong, but at Smartee man school, they taught me that 130 is more than 100. In theory this would be enough power in order for it to maintain stability. Build more power plants was the main suggestion by my associates, but unfortunately my computer wouldn't stay on long enough to be able to make more power plants in Sim City 2000.<br />It was a problem that almost brought many nerds in a confined area (very confined,) to using fists in place of their keyboards.<br /><br />All in all, a good time was had by all who brought along plenty of food and a comfy cushion to sit on.<br />But then again, who the fuck were all of these people at the LAN. From what I could tell they looked shifty as though they were going to steal your computer if you left it unattended for five minutes. I should know, we had planned out how to steal Boris' computer and switch all of the parts with ones we didn't need while he was gone.<br />But our conscience kicked in when we saw his little face and realised that he would never get a girlfriend.<br /><br />The wankers playing CS (you know who you are, yes all of you) think that camping is cheating. For your information, camping is a strategy. It is designed around the concept of staying alive and setting traps for the enemy. This is how you win in a real war.<br /><br />Perhaps a series of small LAN events is in order in the future so we can have proper clan match ups and fight to the death and leach from eachother without fear of power failures. Or on the other hand, clan invites only along with regulars and guests.<br /><br />If you want a real review. You will just have to wait until I can be bothered doing it.","clan"]

Many members scattered to various clans, however after a while Rob and Calabria decided they missed [N]. So started their beloved ~[N]ostalgia~ again.<br />We hope to stay this time!<br />Nostalgia means 'wanting to go back to the good old days'. As a clan we remember the community when it used to be alive with activity. This is what fuels the clan, knowing how great Deus Ex used to be.<br /><br />The brother hood will live on...<br />Nostalgia has recently ventured onto 2 new games. CS:CZ and Jedi Knight 2. After MuLe died on JK2, Rob rounded up the members and made the announcement that [N] was born. [N] in jk2 has 2 sides, CTF and FFA. Its ran by 7 council members, consisting of 3 ffa members and 4 ctf members. [N] Sadly died in jk2, but however it has moved into counter strike source! under the leadership of Cyrus. We are currently recruiting in the game, and are hoping to get a server in the summer. "]

Some members like Calabria were my old clanmates, also Rob from even earlier clan, but they recruited a multi-clanner and one of the leaders in particular believed the fake story over me pointing the aliased multi-clanning out to them, so I quit the clan and my adventures continued.<br /><br />According to my memory I'd like to place them in mid tier, but they've really won against so many contemporaries that they deserve that S tier - after all, they won against the clan that REN lost to - it probably helped that Marije who was in every clan could choose which clan to fight for, be it as [N]Chris or [A]Catwoman. Most likely the clan simply evolved from average to top tier in the years after I left and joined REN. I think Cyrus and Spaz both played as beginners in this clan, possibly Spaz' friend GrimRaper also, but not entirely sure about that anymore. I also think there must've been some flow of members to and from [V] clan, with [N] serving as a starting point to some members but them returning back to [N] afterwards, perhaps."]

Its essentially combining some remnants of a more advanced beginner clan {EoD} and a fresh beginner clan Voice From Within after their destructive merge - soon after also picking up members from the disintegrating {EoD} follow-up {MoH} by another leader figure of that clan. Plenty players who obtained skill in this clan would later make it to [REN]. Not clear how clan would've reacted to auged challenge but since we got steamrolled by pros in both it wouldn't have really mattered.",

                "backgroundStory" : ["","ken","Ken:","I tried merging my beginner clan ¥ into {EoD} because I was getting bored and wanted cool things to happen, the merge as most all merges ended up killing both clans, I think in part because I quit soon after and enjoyed a brief period of being clanless. Me and GD then went on to make [NEM] last moments of 2004 - my second clan - JCmental made {MoH} with {EoD} remnants already a month before that. MoH endured a while but without GreatDane's presence offering stability it didn't manage to do so indefinitely, as for [NEM]: it came and went in two waves, as I was able to focus on one single clan increasingly longer periods of time but it was still fairly little, going from 1.5 months in first clan to 3 months second clan and over 6 months revival. If I remember correctly, we put [NEM] on a pause instead of outright killing it in spring 2005.<br /><br />We grew rapidly and had practice sessions, including augs which I forced everyone to play in these training games and watching like a hawk that everyone would get their practice in and not try to weasel out of augs. Its a fine line between forcing people to play something they're not used to, or instead motivating them while respecting the limits, and I did my best to fall into the latter category. Watching GreatDane with plasma rifle was great. I do think though that I was probably not the only player whose computer couldnt handle auged action framerate, or truth be told: couldnt handle the game in general.<br /><br />More noteworthy moments with this clan were that in spite of being very ambitious and active, we were not really a match to any of the top players for most part, some like me and Psycho were hardware-limited for years, and others simply lacked the experience. A typical mid-tier clan.<br /><br />Another moment is that as I gained experience I ended up hanging out with some questionable characters, recruiting [TDH]Nukem, even the infamous multiclanner Marije around same time, and more problematically got pretty close with a couple UK botters who I let play for my clan here, most notably Labtec who joined through his friend and our mutual contact LazyStoner. He was sort of my secret weapon. For a short while I suddenly had a fairly obnoxious attitude akin to the chavs at the time, and turned a blind eye to the two-three most sus members. Labtec, who had been kicked out of DCSB not long before, really didnt care anymore about the game and I think the rare times he came to play he was always botting, LazyStoner however played with me and GS guys quite a lot normally as well, maybe only putting it on if someone pissed him off. I dont remember these individuals affecting any of our wars, of which there mustve been around six or aroundabouts.<br /><br />The clan was very large and in no time at all we were building up USA division, featuring players like Excsm and Blaze, others. This was also largely in thanks to most of the [UE] inactive roster ending up in our clan and whom I never saw play after that. I dont think DestroyerZero was among those who came over, though, as we had our disagreements by then that likely provoked me to bring [NEM] back.<br /><br />I think a memory from the first [NEM]: I focused on clan democracy and when two members Calabria and MastaKilla had a fierce falling out I tried to get them to apologize to one another, as that failed we held a poll and Calabria had a little bit more support than Masta so I was forced to kick the player I knew better of the two, as people had decided so. Both of them would go on to make their own clans soon.<br /><br />The two times I shut it down with GreatDane it was some kind of mix of boredom and burning out, but my focus was improving with every clan. He would go on to try Counter Strike Source with [DF]Spike under that tag, and at some point was playing that game for [N].<br /><br />Non-aug super groups of time,[TT], [DCSB], the short but bright [V], they would come and go in this time, preparing scene for the [REN] clan next year."]

Im discussing with Dirt on the possibility of possibly assigning admin status to several more people beside me, of course these assigned admins should be more then qualified in order to take the job..since i can't be there all the time the server is being hosted..That is if Dirt decide to host more extensively..if not in which case anyway, i will try to host extensive for the community..once i get my DSL connection..soon hopefully..*sigh*.<br /><br />Any comment or suggestion are welcome here or if personal should once again go to (your untruly) /../ ! ;)"]

Realizing they will never fight my strong clan, I randomly happened upon Phantom waiting in public before scheduled match - ex clan mate in REN and now one leader figure in this clan - and I decided to throw away my mortal feud with him and asked if he can give me war password. To my surprise he did, probably realizing the strength of the opponent. He even sorted out which member is absent that can lend me the name and tag - it turned out to be the young and fierce Frenchman (NKz)Bam whose role I then assumed. In hindisight I am not sure if I joined for the first map or if it was already the second map in shape of CMD and the first one had not gone so well.<br /><br />I had a good strong going on CMD headshotting Spaz just seconds in, Fullmoon very soon quit the match, Phantom lasted entire map but did not stay for Silo. I believe my score was nicely positive which against the likes of Monkee and Ste and Spaz and whoelse happened to be there was good, Phantom I believe was struggling to maintain an even score even with his speedhack and camping - I remember him having something like 21-22 or something like that, other NKz who played were not a threat to opponent. On Silo I just chilled with who I think were two brothers, from Italy or US or Im not sure from where, we were possibly a man down and at this point it was A!B hunting me on an open map. Later I heard that the mysteriously good performance of some noob called Bam was creating discussion among opponent behind the scenes as the match progressed, and Dani who saw the screenshots figured Bam mustve played the game of his life. Considering Bam said he'd stab me during some discussion on forums a while earlier, it made it all the more funnier. NKz never stood a chance in this war and A!B was aware of it, likely just focusing on outsmarting the speedhacking powercouple Phantom-Fullmoon.","isCertain"]

Our Clan is firmly based on having fun, and making some good mates in the DX community. Our goal is to kick all your arses sometime later when we develop some real skills. [nR] is steadily growing with about five members, pretty soon we'll have a whole army! So sit back, relax, grab some pop-corn, and watch us kick arse - its gonna be a long night folks! IF YOU WISH TOO HAVE A CLAN MATCH, PLEASE E-MAIL ME ON /../.<br /><br />But.. If you're not just another lazy internet 'surfer' moron who mistook this for a porn site, have a look at the different sections of this site, and join us for a round of DX sometime. Who knows, if you're good enough we might even let you join us (I see you're already gasping in awe!).<br /><br />Cya's around -[nR]Spetsnaz"]

It was a larger and mainly North-America based group that would fade out not long after taking a defeat from the new non-aug supergroup DCSB which this time was tilted more towards Europe.

The boundaries of imagination, the dreamworld, are undefined -- infinite.  The dreamworld has evolved into the void, and the evolution is continual, as new players join, skills are learned and mastered, and as the present becomes the past.  The name 'The Void' was chosen because of the obvious link between Dream World Kings and Evolution.

DX2MP will follow, in some form, either made by Ion Storm, a player or group of players, or a collaborative effort between the them.  The resulting increased pool of available players means that many new clans will spawn, grasping for their place in the ranks of the DX2MP heirarchy.  With the name recognition that DWK and Evolution had in the original DXMP, each would stand to do well, but possibly no better than other clans from DX1, in recruitment efforts.  The goal here is to consolidate resources - websites, forums, links, information, game servers, and of course, players and talent.  The new Void clan will have a presence in the original DX.  Any clan with a presence in the original game has an inherent legitimacy which will attract better talent and members during early recruitment during DX2MP, and this is why the familiar tags {DWK} and {Evo} will no longer be seen without the attached {Ø} tag, and will be retired.  The increased presence will carry over into DX2MP, and with our tag at the forefront, we will be able to attract considerably more members."]

Reactor worked perfectly, it came from the Juno Reactor name, which is also an electronic band. (Great music by the way for those who are interested).<br /><br /><h1>H I S T O R Y</h1><br />[R] Has a history that has been bumpy, it was formed to fill a hole where DMI was supposed to leave off. Designed to be a clan of clan members, the best of the best, making one unstoppable unit. This is still the goal but we are going about it slightly differently. We aren't stepping on toes to do it. The initial clan line up which was 8 people, including the founder Merlin[DMI].<br /><br />Initially things went smoothly for gather players under [R], but complications between members of [DMI] who were in [R] made things come to a very quick halt, 2 people left, then 3, then 4, then Merlin decided to go back to [DMI] as well and abandon [R]. Merlin will tell a different story but this is how it really went down. The three remaining members like the concept, and the name and had already built up somewhat of a reputation under the [R] monicker. We continued on with it.<br /><br />The decision between the three members was we were not going to have a leader, but rather we would all share the duties of running the clan, recruiting, and making any decisions along the way. Ancestor, Merc and Stormbringer all hit it off and have a mutual respect and vision for the clan.<br /><br />A few days after this decision Merlin had decided that maybe [DMI] wasn't the way to go and was fairly persistent on regaining [R], not as a member but as a leader, which we had already decided against. Shit flew, and Merlin did eventually give up. Don't get us wrong, our clan has absolute respect for Merlin and we were all sorry with the way things ended up, yet it's for the best in the end. There was too much conflict when he was involved, that's what [R] is trying to prevent.<br /><br />[R] is continuing to build, and is recruiting and training new members, things are working well and running absolutely smoothly. The future is bright.<br /><h1>T H E   W A Y   W E   W O R K</h1>Decisions are made between the three head members, as far as recruiting, accepting new members and matches are all put through the three Elders first. It is either a vote, or something that everyone needs to decide to move ahead with. We aren't tyrants, we are just members that do all the work.<br /><br />We respect all our members, that is after all why they are in [R]. We love hearing their ideas and everybody get's a say on the way things go, we are always willing to listen, but by no means can another member make a decision on the clans behalf without talking to the 3 main elders. No one person in the clan has the power to bring in new members, it all comes down to a vote and a discussion. All players need to be tested as well.<br /><br />We share in this clan, most people are willing to help with their spare time, to make sure all clan members are the best that they can be... this is important. Practice sessions happen where everybody will critique each others playing style, this is not to offend or make fun of the other player, but to improve their game play.<br /><br />Most importantly, we have fun, it's a game and we all enjoy it. That's how we work."]

[R] at one point was entirley my baby and i left it to neglect, not that NC wasn't doing a great job, but i wasn't being the support it needed. For everybody who played with us and against us we thank you all.<br /><br />Since the hay-day of [R] i have found that life has taken a much greater presidence over the game which has made it difficult to keep up with updates and to even play the game at all. I apologize to everybody for not being there as much as i should have.<br /><br />The forums will stay up indefinatley, there is no reason to take them down. We will need somebody to administer them though if NC is choosing not to do so.<br /><br />I do miss the game and miss the community, but real life is far too important to me right now. I too when i play will never be without my [R] tag.<br /><br />Maybe in the future i will find time to work on the Reactors again and we can be reborn, i certainly hope so.

It didn't take me long to get hooked again. I was still pretty upset about the DMI thing, I felt I would be part of the clan forever. Merlin wanted to start a new clan. I hesitantly agreed with him, and decided to play as SecondHandSmoke for whatever reason. Jadesfire (who I tried, unsuccessfully, to court into joining DMI on more than one occasion) said she wanted to be a part of it, thus, Reactors was born. Jade and Merlin got into it on MSN, I think she quit the clan in a matter of hours. Merlin was on a heavy recruiting spree, I didn't know any of the people he was letting in. I don't know if I stayed with the clan more than a day or not, but eventually I decied to go solo again. Merlin built up the roster, and then he left the clan as well. So if you hadn't heard the story of how [R] became a bastardized clan, there you go.<br /><br />I stayed solo for a while. TM was MIA attending to personal stuff, he eventually returned to DX and hinted to me again that he may be joining DEA. I asked him to put a word in for me, thinking there was no way in hell it would happen. Merlin approached me on MSN wanting to start up another clan. He already had a list of people wanting to be a part of it, and asked if I was interested. I told him I didn't want to be part of any clan except DMI, and wished him luck with it. I honestly thought Immortals would go the same way Reactors went. Some time later, TM told me he got into DEA. It wasn't very long until I got an email from Joe asking me to join as well. I was in disbelief, as was everybody else the first time I joined a server with the new tag. Merlin was PISSED."]

Soon [TT] veteran Trollied was recruited. Few days after the clan was founded we challenged [Shen], on 22nd of April.

With that, REN was closed.<br />Unlike NEM which had a US division, on my suggestion and with Chaos' approval we kept REN 100% Euro to maintain one solid lineup, but somehow we still ended up having Gaz from the States which was a bit of a mistake but probably just reflected our (or mine) atdm aspirations. Most members were capable of playing some level of atdm, but active roster did not contain enough dedicated augers to challenge other highly skilled aug clans - from inactives we wouldve been able to muster a team. I recall turning to Chaos with the idea of training together enough to beat [3] in ATDM, but I think he felt it was not worth the effort it would take - as we were feared in non-aug they were feared in augs, and there was a pretty good reason why.<br /><br />On the single clan war loss we suffered: I wanted to make this the most epic war ever, that meant making it as large as possible since both clans had the theoretical capacity for it, in practice however it usually came down to grabbing whoever happened to be there and its questionable whether DXMP server even can handle such a load. That meant that while Alpha was luckily for them able to put in some European 0aug veterans and legends, I ended up boosting our side with a rusty American auger who was easy pickings for the enemy immediately, adding to that the server performance tanked so much that we had to adjust for the kind of lag that we simply had not anticipated or practiced for. As a result of all that we started to lose focus and the most active competitive team in DXMP lost to retired players who no longer actively played. Although I think the loss was personally my fault alone with some decisions made, in the end I wanted an Epic and Memorable match, and I think that was absolutely accomplished."]

Well the founder was KillingMachine who was fairly new to the game. [RTK] was founded in the beginning of August 2006. First, it was KillingMachine all by himself in the clan. It was like this for a month and a half. I'm going to keep it real with you guys. I didn't know anything about clans or online multiplayer games. Which put me at a disadvantage for starting my own clan. Then, some hope came. I met a Deus Ex player named Jima B. He was more experience with clans than I was. So I recruited him even though we just met.<br /><br />Jima brung a whole lot of good things to [RTK]. He was active, maps, and hosted [RTK] first server. This was way before the [RTKM] server people. The server was named [RTK] Public Server. This server made the clan more known in Deus Ex Multiplayer Community. But, we was still having trouble though. Our recruiting was horrible and we was never prepared to fight in clanwars. Mind you, that this was my first time ever making a clan. We recruited anybody in sight and it didn't matter if they had skill or not. [RTK] began to be one of the biggest clans in Deus Ex History. Alot of clans hated us cause we was so big and recruited anybody in sight. Most of them was haters anyway. They still hate us till this date. My goal in making this clan was to become more of a family than a clan just with players in it. So then, I met Rambo. The guy was a good asset for the clan. His skills with the sniper was above average. Me and Rambo got along well. Great Attitude in game and out of the game. He experience the same thing I have experienced in our first clans we joined. They weren't organized and we was heading in the same direction they was going. We decided to take a different route. Looked and learned from other clans that was big in the community already. Saw that they had forums which we did not have.<br /><br />[RTK] finally got their first forums ever. It was a little slow at first. I have to thank Unwanted for showing us how to use forums. Since we didn't know how or ever used them. This made us a little more organised. Then, I made Jima B and Rambo my co-leaders since they was their with me in the beginning and helped me out alot. We decided to do some reconstruction to the clan. We had alot of multiclanners in our clan. Kicked more than half of the members out of [RTK]. Started with a new recruiting system using our forums. Everything was going smooth and we was becoming more organised. Then we had some disputes with some Deus Ex players. Our first forums got taken over. This was a big blow to the clan.<br /><br />So we had to start all over. Even though this was frustrating we did it anyway. Clan became more closer because of this. Most of the loyal members stayed and some unloyal ones left. The clan recovered from this attack. Made a new forum, that is one of the most popular forums in the Deus Ex Multiplayer Community today. We fought in many clan wars. Also, we have a popular 24/7 server up, we recruited skilled players, we made custom mods, and maps. We are still trying to improve in alot of areas though. We not that far from reaching our goal in becoming one of the best clans in Deus Ex History. Even though the Deus Ex Multiplayer lost alot of its players and clans. This clan will never give up on Deus Ex. We will be the last clan left in Deus Ex"]

I am still going to play as [S]Hydra, and I hope you keep your clan tags too so people can always remember what a great clan we almost were. I also ask that you keep in contact with me, as I am going to be forming (hopefully) a page on PlanetDeusEx.com, a tribute to all the great players, mappers and modders before they get forgotten.

I believe that I can bring it back to life and restore it to it's original glory! As your leader, the first thing that I'm going to do is require all S members to post a message under this topic stateing that they are still in S. Anyone who doesn't post is not in S. You have one week to reply or you will have to tryout again to get back into the clan. We need order in the clan and getting a solid memebers list is the foremost thing that needs to be done. For those of you who don't know, I have made a Stalkers web site, where all the links work, and it fits the Stalker 'mood'. The address is Stalkers.8m.com. Also we need more good players. If you see anyone with a kill/death ratio of 5/1 or better, or a streak of at least 10, and they have no clan tag, then find out if they want to join. If so then we will set up a tryout where I will evaluate their performance, and see if they are good enough.

So happy 6 month birthday Stalkers. We will do something special soon, maybe a server, a match or something nice.<br /><br />I have two mins so I'd like to teach all you young whipper snappers a quick lesson in how we started. Well, it was in the old days, when few people knew DX had MP and people didn't know what ADS was for real. Times were good. A few fast servers, new ones sprouting everyday (Running with Scissors- any memories?). I was whipping ass on the DM and TDM servers, when I ran into another ass-kicker. He went by the name Buddah, and almost beat me. We made a great team, so I asked if he wanted to start a clan with me. So we did, and it began. Something few people know is we had a choice between two names: [BR]- Bad Religion or [S]- Stalkers.<br /><br />Soon after, we started recruiting, and nabbed some quality players (MaxRuler, DaHumla, Punisher, GrAfFiX2). As we grew, along did the four other 'superpowers', [DUI], [BH], and [DEA]. Like in so much world history, two of those were obliterated (well pretty much). The remaining two, [S] and [DEA] have picked up the pieces and become the two best clans. There have been many triumphs (the split up of c22 *like Germany after WW2*) and pitfalls (the splitup of [BH] and [DUI]). But we made it and thrived. So thats our story.'<br /><br />BR- it never came around, that wasn't us. The second email I received from Buddah was before we had four members, so we had no name except Stalkers. <span data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='bottom' title='OldGrandad'>OG</span>: I can't wait to play this map. If its OK with him, I'll put some nice phat screenshots up on APH and you can look at that detail. The party will be a little delayed, but hopefully not too much. I have exams for two weeks from Monday, so you probably won't see much of me until then. I will not be playing under [S]Hydra so if you see anyone there as that name then tell your local admin to boot/ban 'em."]

Stalkers was originally founded by both Buddah and Hydra, but due to unknown events Buddah was unable to continue playing the game, so Hydra took full control. Soon after the inauguration of the clan, three additional members joined; Silverfox, GrAfFiX2 and the legendary MaxRuler.</p><p>The building blocks of a high quality and prominent clan were in place. Within only a couple of weeks more members were recruited, including the renowned Punisher with his trusty pistol, and Beast - one of the strongest players at the time. The foundation was there, recruiting was at a high, and additional quality players were allowed to join the ranks, including DaHumla, Amigo, Face, Shard and OldGrandad.</p><p>Within a short space of time Stalkers had grown into a force not to be reckoned with. In its early days the clan had alliances with other clans, including [SaF] Called United Killers [UK]. “when looking back I can't really imagine what we must have been thinking, we were all a bit crazy about Deus Ex and well, stuff like this was pretty normal back then…” says Punisher.</p><p>Unfortunately Hydra wasn't able to commit to the time consuming task of leading and organising the clan. Things started to get out of control and no one seemed to know who was in, and who was out. A few members tried to start up a 2 vs. 2 league, but that failed. Clan matches also failed because of unacceptable lag, a result of being unable to book the best servers in town.</p><p>The situation got worse; new members were joining all the time without a trial and without the remaining [S] members being asked beforehand. The clan was deteriorating, and in an attempt to alleviate matters, Hydra formed a second division, [S2], but it wasn't taken seriously and ultimately failed.</p><p>With all these problems, members including Amigo, Beast, Face and Punisher left the clan. Stalkers continued for a short while, Hydra (the leader) became inactive. In a last bid attempt to keep the Stalkers name alive Beast rejoined and tried his best at saving the clan. Without the commitment of the few remaining members, Stalkers was left for dead…</p><p>Stalkers was assigned to the shelf collecting dust for almost a year, but one of the original members, Face, resurrected the clan and has taken responsibility. “None of this would be possible without the dedication of some of the other original members, DaHumla, Punisher and Shard” Face said. “Although we may not be the best players now, we are coming back to inject “new” life into the game. It's not just about winning, it's about playing the game without a bad attitude and basically being a good sport. Stalkers is different to the other clans, we're here for the game, nothing else”. Our new recruits have been specially selected for their ability to play the game and their overall attitude. Currently there are three members on trial, DarkAssassin, Eagle and Hittman.</p><p>Stalkers is here to stay. With every member of the clan being involved with the decision of taking on new members, we are sure that minimal problems will arise, and that everyone in the clan will know each other. This was one thing that never happened in Stalkers the first time around, and is the main reason behind the clan becoming unmanageable in the first place.<p>- Written by Punisher, edited by Face.</div>"]

Although initially I pitched the single-digit super-rare or super-common tag ideas, Swim already had a concept of Swimverse developing - and once I realized how perfectly my recent alias RockLobster went with it, the name and tag were decided. Nineteen minutes all in all, the stars aligned this time in creative process.<br /><br />I remember it crystal clear: the first day was tenuous for the clan as neither put tag on yet, likely to let the idea sink in deeper and to assess each-others play with a new focus - but by the second day Swim put tag on and I followed suit, and the clan was born in real.<br /><br />When it came to recruiting members, I sought players whose style would synergize well primarily with Swim, but also who I could rely on. Indian special forces SpecX came to mind, but an unfortunate turn of events meant that he was no longer an active member of our playerbase of dozen or so gamers. Realizing my options are rather limited, with the partners go-ahead I just decided to poach two likeminded vets with a similar style to mine from another clan, and thus with Duke and Psycho added to our pool we were set for wars.<br /><br />Our first war was on the second day of Swim World's existence, against a freshly emerged simp clan Price Appreciation [PE] that had formed around the legacy of the rice messiah Marshall subMarsh Price. They had pink names and couldnt jump walls and were annoying in general, so the conflict and drama were ripe in the air. Unfortunately we lost all maps, but there were circumstances.<br /><br />Day later we announced the death of our clan, primarily attributed to my co-founder moving and becoming busy with studies, but also to the general dissatisfaction with the state the game was in that me and several other active players shared. I wrote the closing word and we decided to publish it to the community:<br /><br />'I fear the end of our clan may be near - our members have turned to alcoholism, our founder and muse departs in pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and the world's oceans are becoming increasingly anoxic with rising temperatures .<br /><br />Whats left is just to enjoy this one pleasant night with our brothers in arms with whom we've bonded over these intense days full of rainbow shades of emotion, and to wave our little crab hands goodbye to the mother that has nurtured us 23 years .<br /><br />Was it a magical chance that brought us together or was it the gulf stream, but this humble reef of bustling activity and sheer joy that we created with yet so little will always remain close to my heart .'<br /><br />But veteran players as we both were, already at that point we knew there was potential for a come-back, one day. I think it was one of the best clans I've been in."]

                "backgroundStory" : ["On THC forums, also in our Stories section","shades","Shades:","I befriended a young US targeter called Firerunner. Eventually we decided to make our own clan and call it [FBF]ForgedByFire. Some guys complained that we stole their tag and wanted to war us for the rights to it. Once they realised how good FIRERUNNER was they said we could keep it, but we let them have it instead, and I came up with the [T] tag.<br /><br />We recruited rapidly, basically trying to recruit anyone who could beat us. FIRERUNNER grabbed a guy called Souljah who was a good all round player. [DEA] made a few attempts to recruit FIRERUNNER iirc, backtracking on their earlier cheat accusations against him. But like me, he disliked the monopoly DEA had on the game. I wasn't having much luck recruiting as everyone I tried to recruit was holding out for a slot in DEA. e.g., I tried to recruit Darkiuxx, but he joined DEA instead. Then one day I played against a guy called GodExMachina in Silo who was pretty amazing with Plasma. I thought he was an alias for [BK]Auselan who was also good with plasma. But when I kept seeing this GodEx ([T]AlCapone) guy owning all the time even with other weapons, and noticed that he kept pretty quiet and cool, I thought I'd try and recruit him. I was surprised and excited when he said yes straight away.<br /><br />People wanted to join [T] when they saw how good FIRERUNNER was. I think he got two other players: Orangeblood and Born2Snipe, who were pretty decent riflers, although I never played them much. OrangeBlood came back a year or two ago because I remember playing a few maps with him. I've played Born2Snipe about 18 months ago too. I even saw some guy from FIRERUNNER's old clan [DXA] in A51 about 6 months ago: 'Azzkicker'. He couldn't believe it when I remembered him from a decade ago. We also recruited a friend of FIRERUNNER's first clan leader (MajorKickAss) called Nomad, who was an interesting person to talk to on MSN.<br /><br />I used to stay up til 3am in the morning on school nights waiting for FIRERUNNER and Souljah to come on AIM so we could go in the US servers.<br /><br />A few months later, when my GCSEs were done with, I came back and the Euro servers were pretty dead. TCN had permabanned Messiah and his brother DBL iirc. I decided to start recruiting for [T] again so we could challenge the likes of [DEA] and a now strong [3]. Around that time I recruited a French tanker called TITANK who was improving at a quick rate.<br /><br />After even more months of inactivity, I made another come back and finally managed to get a new dedicated 128mb ASUS A7V8X graphics card too. I was also pleased to get hold of one of the best players this game has seen who most people know as [I]Trauma. He was banned from [DEA] when I managed to persuade him to leave their clan for [T]. Everyone warned me that he would leave straight away because he was a serial multiclanner/name changer, but I ignored their warnings. This started off a lot of shit talk with [DEA]. They realised that [T] was now a threat to them because we had one of DXs best players. TonyMontana claimed that before that he had never even heard of us, and tried to downplay our threat.<br /><br />I thought [T] was on the ascendancy when we recruited Trauma, but Souljah started to make joke tags like [DWIP] (something to do with insect porn). He also tried to persuade us into coming into servers to teamkill with him. When Trauma told him to stop Souljah accused him of being gay etc etc and they fell out. In the meantime he had recruited a few members but my memory is hazy over exactly who: TeamMossad and Kago, I think. Trauma also used a new alias every game so that people such as Messiah would contact me on MSN asking who our new players were. Everyone thought we had an army of good players, when in reality they were all Trauma under alias; and in reality we still had very few active members; and those that were active usually spent most of the time teamkilling.<br /><br />I also took a chance on recruiting a kid called Will, which probably didn't add to our reputation. Even though everyone hated Will and mocked him, I found him to be kind of likeable - if a bit annoying - and so decided to stick up for the underdog. Some examples of the gay things he used to do though include: going in [DEA] server with dynamic IP and using 'reloadcount 0' to throw multiple lams around the server until it lagged out. At the time [DEA] could find no real way to stop him - I can't even remember if MTL existed then - so he was like a little terrorist. Another time, he made a webcam video mimicking [I]Hitokiri, in which he mocked Hitokiri's ghetto Azn demeanor. In the video Will was topless, waving his fingers around, and wearing a cap saying: “Yoyoyo, gangster yo, I'm Hito and I'll bust a cap in yo' ass.” To be fair, I think this was in response to some [I]mmortal members leaving calls on Will's family home answering machine - probably saying something about his mother - but I can't remember.<br /><br />Firerunner and I did virtually quit, but we were just thoughtful enough not to do the old 'DX is dying, I quit thread' that most other attention-whores used to break up their clans. Instead we decided to carry on in a ghost role, so others could carry on if they wanted to, and so we could maybe come back one day.<br /><br />In our absence [T] managed to maintain a cult following just enough to keep it alive. Firerunner had made some good recruits in the past that came back from time to time and gave the clan a bit of a legacy. Unfortunately, [T] was also known for another legacy because of a small contingent of hangers on, who enjoyed aliasing and teamkilling. It got to the point where I didn't like the direction the clan was taking, but since I'd already gave up my responsibilities and relinquished control of the clan by then, it would've been unfair of me to start dictating how I wanted it run. That said, I left [T] officially for [I]. Firerunner wasn't too happy when he found out, but I think he understood.<br /><br />Nevertheless, despite its lack of any substantial backing e.g., a dedicated fast server, scheduled clan wars, forums, or active members, it managed to go a long way. Edit for clarity: We didn't have all this when I was active, but later on when I'd already left [T]AlCapone provided all this. It probably helped that we had always promoted the idea of no central leadership. It is just a shame that the cheesy name 'Transcend' also seemed to attract a certain contingent of players who seemed to join more as a joke than anything else. Sadly, they were the same ones prone to suicide gepping, teamkilling, and multiple aliases. When I left I expected [T] would just fade into obscurity, but [T]AlCapone (Russ/GodEx) did a good job of turning the clan around and giving it a second lease of life. For a while they became pretty competitive again, but that is a story someone like Jej could probably tell better.<br /><br />And Russ played DXMP much less actively /../, yet still managed to keep a clan going /../. Also, Russ wasn't around at the times you probably think he was - and was probably our most inactive member before I quit. He became his most active after Firerunner and I had already left in an official capacity for other clans. I'm not trying to call him out because he was a good guy and I know he had a lot of passion for [T]; the same passion that I wish I still had. But the truth remains that he had to come back from months at a time of inactivity to resurrect a - for most intents and purposes - already dead at the time [T]. I think maybe Kingpin and a few suicide gep newbs using multiple aliases still kept it running. And if I'd wanted to be super-gay, I could've asked Firerunner (who still hadn't left for [BK] yet iirc), to claim ownership of the clan and stop Russ when he came back to resurrect the tag a couple of months later.<br /><br />The fact that [T] managed to make a comeback under the guidance of [T]AlCapone; with only one or two of the original members, and the fact that it managed to redeem a tarnished reputation of being so full of aliases, teamkillers and aimbotters, is testament to the fact that [A!B] has as much, if not more, of a chance at survival than [T] because even we don't act as gay as the levels [T] reached at some points. Even if our reputation hasn't been perfect, and even if no one does take us seriously, history is on our side. We currently have 4 or 5 members who have played this game for a long time, and will likely be here until the end."]

Apart from being a supremely nice guy, he's spent money and time on the clan. I'm fairly certain he's the one who pays for the http://clan-transcend.com domain or w/e you call it and was instrumental in bringing back the clan forums, along with flaw and unr3al, after Spaz ([A!B] Member) posted naked pics of Shauns fat sister and he ran off with the database. Another story. As far as his activity, I joined [T] DX in 2005 so I can't speak to that. I will say that when [T] played Project Snowblind, Russ bought the game along with other [T] members and played it.<br /><br />I'll take exception with the aimbotting bit. I never saw anyone in [T] use a bot (for suicide gepping wtf?) although System said somewhere that Shaun apparently ported it. Shaun denied it. Can't get on board with the history being on your side bit.<br /><br />Below is a portion of the [T] history compiled by clan members in 2005 or so. I referred to this in a previous post. Putting it in here now for completion. I'll just post comments and random info for the rest here. Question (to Shades): I haven't noticed you mentioning time periods to go with the events...? I'm especially curious as to the approximate start of [T] (Capone had it as Sep 2001 below)...<br /><br />This history doesn't include Spaz posting naked pictures of Shaun's(he was [W]eeirdoo if you remember) sister and his(Shaun's) subsequent sacking of the old website and forums.<br />Spaz (don't know if you know him), a [T] member, got sent pictures of Shaun's sister from Shaun's sister. Spaz then asked the clan if he should post them, shaun and unr3al said no, the rest said yes. then the forums and site and shaun were gone.<br />this is a new forums etc. that was spearheaded by flaw and unr3al and capone or something started earlier this year or late last year."]

                "backgroundStory" : ["[T] forums, reposted on [THC] forums by jEj","t","","The first incarnation of [T] was created in September of 2001 when Shades and FireRunner sought to fill a vacuum in the multiplayer clan landscape of Deus Ex. A roster was quickly filled by players including [T]eamMossad, [T]itank and [T]AlCapone. During this time, [T] did not lose a clan battle and was one of the dominant groups of gamers in the Deus Ex world. Unfortunately, time passed and [T] eventually faded to one or two members who were rarely in contact. Some stopped playing and some moved on to other clans. This was not the end, though.<br /><br />Rebirth: In 2003, [T]AlCapone, who had reverted to wearing the tag again after the meltdown of [Ð], decided to bring back [T]. With the help of former [DK] and [W] member WeEiRdOo, a clan infrastructure was organized making [T] a recognised name again. The eventual collapse of [W] provided [T] with fRoSt and Vortell near this time. A fiery young asian boy began associating with the clan during this period as well. Constantly begging for change, he was finally admitted to [T] on a lark in the hopes that he would soon do something to get himself kicked. Alas, Kao, aka. The Jap, is still with us..<br /><br />In March of 2005 [T] became one of the first, and one of two, dominant clans in Project: Snowblind. Touted as the next game in the Deus Ex series, Project: Snowblind failed to live up to expectations. This didn’t stop two players, [T]JeJ[DX] and [T]Aris666, from winning worldwide scoring competitions and representing [T] on a global stage.<br /><br />Today, [T] has a wide and varied assemblage of personnel with members on 4 different continents. The clan is the most irreverent grouping in the Deus Ex world - typified by the world famous [T]fukHead whose battle cry of, “Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa” is often imitated but never duplicated. [T] hopes to exist well into the future and maybe, just maybe, piss you off."]

We agreed to play three maps but we only played two because of arguements about the maps with some &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; members. There was some lag on the &#x005B;DEA&#x005D; server when about 2-3 minutes was left of the first map. The first map was Area51Bunker and you can check the results under the 'Wars' link. Second map was played on Jolt.co server because the &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; members wanted to play it there. So we changed the server and put the Silo map on. Silo was won by Triad and smuggler remained unplayed, mostly because the start of the game was delayed because KingLouie&#x005B;TCN&#x005D; and Riddler&#x005B;TCN&#x005D; were late. It was a good and very skilled game, the attitude could have been nicer though. Thank you &#x005B;TCN&#x005D; for a good match.'","isCertain"]

We have realized what DXMP is all about. As a teaser, I can tell you that it's not banning weapons and removing map features just because you can't handle them.We have realized that the developers actually had something in mind when they included turrets, LAM's, GEP guns and augmentations in DXMP. They did not put them there because they wanted people to exclaim “n00b” and leave the server in order to put up their own one, without the parts of the game they can't handle.<br /><br />The Directive for the Promotion of Augmented Deathmatch (which can conveniently be abbrevated The Directive or simply TDA) was founded on the 6th of Mars 2004 under the name Echelon 3 (E3). At the start, it was only a clan of friends, namely mikwae, Playerone and Borsellini. Since then, we have grown... a little. The clan has changed a lot, but still consists of mostly the same members. Most are very inactive. On the 2nd of Mars 2005, we changed name to The Directive, taking a more active stance in the war of the augmentations.<br /><br />And now we are at the core of the poodle. The augmentations. Terribly underrated. Spat at. We want to change this. Deus Ex without augmentations is just a slower UT with less interesting weapons. We want people to realize the potential in this mode of play. The augs adds a new dept to the game. It is not just a shooter where the one whith the best 41mz0r sk1llz is the winner, but a game of many layers, where tactics and planning are prominent features.<br /><br />That is why we promote Augmented Deathmatch.

[TMFDX]'s first member was EvilStar, a player in the EF section of [TMF], who has now gone on to have a major role in leading the clan. We are currently recruiting players, and are going to be the FIRST clan signed up to the new Deus Ex League!<br />For more info on [TMF] as a whole, goto www.the-mortal-fist.com and select [TMF].<br /><br />[TMFDX]Death <br /><br /><br />Motto: Together we stand, together we will NOT fall !<br /><br />Founders: Patrick (18) and Michel (26), two brothers from Sweden.<br /><br />This clan became a reality when we both had tested the demo version of the superb game called STAR TREK VOYAGER…ELITE FORCE and Patrick came up with the briliant idea to start a clan. Patrick is a huge Star Trek fan and has put hours and hours in the making of his Star Trek inspired site (wich he have been awarded for) and me being a gamer made the choice easy….we started The Mortal Fist Clan.<br /><br />This clan will be open for everyone, amateurs, pros, girls and boys, women and men as long as you want to be a proud member of our clan and as long as you  follow the rules that we have put together.<br /><br />The key to succes is simple, help the beginers – give them advice, let them know your best and most usefull tricks, but remember….don’t let other clans know our secrets and strategis…and remember that we are all on the same side, UNITY IS STRENGHT !<br /><br />The Mortal Fist Crew"]

I personally haven't seen GoD playing but I have heard that he is damn good. The fifth member is certain to be MastaPopo. Cheeze has vastly improved recently and should be on form for the match. The sixth member is not sure yet, there is three people fighting to get it.

The first one was against S and that was a big flop. TN lost very badly, though they didn't have their best player, only 3 of TN elite members were in the game including TicTacToad and semisonic. This time ThugNation will be more prepared. TicTacToad has arranged the game so that everyone there will be from TN elite.

However, watching the recruitment process of others I finally asked to join and got a trial myself, quickly climbing in ranks the brothers had. At some point we formed our own small group of friends and moved on to make our own clan, although I briefly was in the next clan by these young welshmen as well. The younger brother Psycho was in our uber non-aug clan REN as well around 2007, so some three years after this. I think the leaders mentioned the clan had like 500 members or something, but at some point inactives were removed."]

In order to keep the fun of the game alive for all of us, we decided to start this new clan together.  Starting over was necessary, so we can now go far beyond our previous limitations."]

Last, it is much better to learn how to use one set of 3-6 weapons than it is actually is to learn how to master around 24 weapons, that the game has.<br /><br />Also, this way will make our team more united, because the other person has a skill you need in order to accomplish a goal. this way we do not have a one person team.<br /><br />To recognize the leaders from the members and the older members from the new ones we have select a star system, the more stars a person has, the more weight in the clan that person has.

Ultimate Unity does not recruit based on skill. While some skill is necessary to join, the clan is based around education. In essence, recruiting average players who are active and are willing to learn and teaching them all the tips and tricks and parts of the maps to the point that they are as good (or better than!) the leaders. This doesn't mean the leaders are bound to always be the clan's best players. [Ux2], or Ultimate Unity recruits elite players too, but does not base their recruiting on eliteness. The only catch is, if you are trained hard and learn a lot you need to help other members of the clan who are below you, or if you are an elite player you need to be willing to help those not as skilled (in clan). It's not this 'you either help him or get kicked out,' as is it's more of a thing where you want to do it. Basicly it's saying that if you join you can't suddenly leave the clan, if you get trained you can't just idle for three months when clan mates need your help, and if you are elite already you just have to be willing to help. We at [Ux2] understand that real life things exist, such as sex, school, family, etc. and are fully understanding when issues such as the above mentioned (and others) come up. If you can't make a clan practice because you need to study for exams, that's fine. Even a date with a girl should take priority over computer games. The only thing we ask is that you notify us. We also disallow any sort of cheating, bug abuse, or mischevious things that can get the clan in trouble."]

Of course they had their bumps on the way; such as members quitting, people wearing the tag without being in the clan, and a member caught cheating. [W] persevered, becoming a well known clan throughout the community.<br /><br />However, all good things must come to an end. In August of 2002, [W] closed its doors. Both leaders were preoccupied with school, and the pressure o leading the clan was overwhelming. It was a sad day for all members. All ex-clan mates pursued other opportunities; some joined other clans while other ended their career.<br /><br />Less than a year later, while conversing, [W]eirdette (now DoomsChik) and [W]eEiRdOo (now DeLuSioN) decided to bring back their old child. [W] returned in the new age of DX, with a system based on the same objectives. Hopefully, [W] will live far into the future, never faltering and always keeping it weird."]
