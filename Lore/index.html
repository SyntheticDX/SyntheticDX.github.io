                <div id="chapter">
                    <div id="shortread"><p>DXMP was born as a prime-time US Beta release on <a class="pagelink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010708111024/http://www.shacknews.com/funk.y?dflat=10955">5</a>th of December, 2000, but as the file took up to four hours to download on a common 56k connection, and reached some of the main mirror sites only after midnight, we can think of the 6th as the "first day" of Deus Ex Multiplayer. The time would be even later for all those enthusiastically downloading the patch from outside of America. Game was a big hit in Europe after all.</p><p>Playerbase was mostly American as the community leader "Slicer" from UK also concluded, but still had plenty Europeans to populate the continent servers with — pings across oceans could easily reach 1000ms and some even claimed to be completely used to 600 ping — and to churn out popular maps with the new editing tools, reaching a real release rush once the final patch shipped.</p><p>Initially slim server list grew daily with additions like "Running with Scissors" server, but it was the "RPGplanet Conspiracy" by GameSpy that become one the first main DXMP servers for the regulars who could enjoy the new and praised custom maps like DXMP_Skyline and the later DXMP_Towers. Interestingly, the least popular stock map was DXMP_Smuggler which was not even put on the rotation — April <a class="pagelink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010607054804/http://dynamic.gamespy.com:80/~aquinas/art.php?pg=Poll+1+Comments">26</a> poll shows DXMP_Area51Bunker winning by a landslide as far as classic maps go, with CMD and Cathedral following in the distance. Administrated by respected and skilled players from several early clans, it quickly allowed a tightly bonded nucleus of a community to form with its many colourful characters united by the passion for the game.</p>

                        <div><p>And what a game: words LAM shield and knife deathmatch rang different then, you could obtain hundreds of ammo and items with a click even from your own body, the infamous "chicken dance" leaning deaths, and then there was the practically infinite bio stacked off corpses that fueled the first tanks of the game. Today perhaps unimaginable, but HE20 was not affected by ADS in this time as DerianX reminds us, its impact yet perhaps somewhat offset by the doubly powerful ES.</p>
                        <p>Talking numbers, plasma and shuriken both were 33% more powerful at base damage, however: the energy shield augmentation was also 37% more effective by absorbing 80% of plasma and explosions compared to the 50% in full release later on — its nearly doubled energy cost also manageable via the many unintended methods mentioned, plus the full repair bot charges through closed doors, or said doors to such valuables often simply forgetting to close. Or you could also partake in the popular activity of camping by the lockers for half a minute in order to grab the loot for the second time before it locked. Regeneration became its own mini-game where faster fingers could stack the heal by a lot during a fight. Plenty fun with grenades planted smack in the middle of doors, weapon racks, or hidden behind computer terminals.</p>
                        <p>That all means that loot and bio was trivial, needing a maximum three shots to the head unupgraded the knives were the weapon to use — even though you'd want the "LAM shield" over combat strength — and plasma was absolutely brutal for wiping out anyone without the protection, or for wiping out their frame rate. Indeed, the frame counts were so low and pings so high that an opponent using speed enhancement might as well have been dodging bullets like Neo from the Matrix, causing some people to switch teams simply to avoid facing them. We know sniper reload was skippable, but low framerates and the generally high pings would complicate the snipe spam that, as old posts show, wouldve been looked down upon by many. It makes some sense then how a combat knife could also net a hundred frags those days, and why quite the number of people are later known as experts of shuriken.</p>
                        <p>Some clans formed early: two-three days after beta launch emerged the Stalkers [S] represented by Hydra, Buddah, MaxRuler, DaHumla, Punisher, GrAfFiX2, Phade, and others, yet they do not claim to be the oldest. Whether true or spoken under the influence, that statement comes from Deusing Under Influence [DUI] with AssRocket, Bigwinky, Eberon, Helios, Charmy, a clan also counted as "one of the great 4" of early days. Yet another contender for the oldest clan is the Black Hand [BH] that in addition to original leaders like Cygnus also included mapper Locke004 and other skilled players WildBill, Garula, Nihilanth, and the polarizing character Deusex: all together forming a smaller than average group that with its shorter life span compared to the more enduring rivals became the signature tag of the distinct Beta era. Fourth large clan that managed to narrowly fit into the year 2000 was the Deus Ex Assassins [DEA] that formed on December <a class="pagelink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010813042346/http://www.ionstorm.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=4&t=000239">30</a> or 31st, featuring the second day player Slicer and the co-founder Boaz, ApocalypseNOW, BigCountry, Andrew. While [AU] Assassins Unlimited apparently managed to beat [DEA] to clan formation by 3-4 days and with a week of preceeding planning, they are rarely mentioned or linked by others.</p>
                        <p>Being early in DXMP history is a coveted achievement that more founders would like to decorate their clan with, sometimes citing dates even before the game release, but if clanned community did not notice them then it is hard to take it seriously. Similarly interesting nuance is that these serious, hardcore and often accomplished individuals who were now discovering Deus Ex deathmatch only had a few weeks of experience to base their early guides and tips sites on, leading to some funny discoveries from a veteran's perspective, be it mysteries surrounding Energy Shield and LAMs, dominating the competitive scene with ActivateAllAugs - or without them entirely.</p>
                        <p>Ion Storm's Deus Ex Multiplayer section was active and Hydra's [S] clan forum took the early central stage for clanned activity in DXMP by hosting sub-boards for tags with members. In shape of Slicer and Hydra both teams had the more social leaders with hand in a wider range of activities in the community, while BigCountry and Beast added the tough, no-nonsense kind of touch. Similarly, BH had the famous Locke who seemed to do everything and WildBill who wondered why people don't move on already to newer competitive titles like CS. [DUI] meanwhile discovered more things to enjoy under the influence, as they're happy to share.</p>
                        <p>Over time these names would become legends of this special time in a frankly quite different game. Everybody will talk of [S]Beast dominating the Multiplayer thats now growing steadily with players and clans, and people recall how Locke004 won matches without even using augmentations. Then the dramatic rise and fall of our star mapper Face, creator of DXMP_Towers map, released in just a week once others started releasing custom maps. And of course the busy-body Slicer who managed to run his IT company, do work for Gamespy, stay in contact with Ion Storm Austin, maintain forums for the community, administrate the main game servers, always look for solutions to problems people were having, change the mind of those who planned to close their clan down, and game at a competitive level - all that off some 4 hours of daily sleep.</p>
                        <p>Below you can see what players tell you about the game themselves:</p>

                                    <q>Well, it was in the old days, when few people knew DX had MP and people didn't know what ADS was for real. Times were good. A few fast servers, new ones sprouting everyday (Running with Scissors- any memories?). I was whipping ass on the DM and TDM servers, when I ran into another ass-kicker. He went by the name Buddah, and <em>almost</em> beat me. We made a great team, so I asked if he wanted to start a clan with me. So we did, and it began. Something few people know is we had a choice between two names: [BR]- Bad Religion or [S]- Stalkers. /.. BR- it never came around, that wasn't us. The second email I received from Buddah was before we had four members, so we had no name except Stalkers. ../ Soon after, we started recruiting, and nabbed some quality players (MaxRuler, DaHumla, Punisher, GrAfFiX2). As we grew, along did the four other 'superpowers', [DUI], [BH], and [DEA]. Like in so much world history, two of those were obliterated (well pretty much). The remaining two, [S] and [DEA] have picked up the pieces and become the two best clans. There have been many triumphs (the split up of c22 *like Germany after WW2*) and pitfalls (the splitup of [BH] and [DUI]). But we made it and thrived.</q>

                        <p>Public release came on March<span> <a class="pagelink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020629031548/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/12613/">2nd</a></span>, 2001, accompanied by Warren Spector's words that its not a full-featured, commercial product but rather developers learning how to make an MP game, and that they hope to see the community use the released editing tools and run with them.</p>

                        <p>Week before the release of 1109fm patch Hydra estimates around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010921175407/http://pub50.ezboard.com:80/fsclansbsboardfrm2.showMessage?topicID=19.topic" class="pagelink">200</a> people playing overall, "so that leave 110 not clanned" as he also counts around 6 clans and puts them at 15 players each, although its not clear how accurate his numbers are - a couple days later as they update Locke004's clan list from old Ion Storm boards they realize they have twice as many clans, with new ones popping up frequently - they give us the general idea of the size of the community just before coming out of Beta. The clans by 24th of Feb, so some 7 days from next patch, are [DUI], [BH], [DEA], [AU], [NOK], [cdp], [c22], [MI], [GDotS] - that they know of, adding [SDM] four days later and making it 10 clans.</p>

                        <p>The clear legend of this era appears to be ApocalypseNOW[DEA], later himself weary of the performance of Trauma, his new competition. One of the TMs of his clan, TonyMontana or TeamMossad (I believe from one of the story/history threads), said he'd pay money to see his demos.</p>
                        
                        <p>Plasma receives 33% base damage nerf and shuriken damage is reduced 32%, energy shield now blocks only 50% of damage instead of the whopping 80% from earlier but is also cheaper to use, shooting legs no longer makes target slower.</p>
                        
                        <p>Servers hosting Skyline after its release on 25th of March: Scouty's Dedicated Tbird, Maverick's Server, Xtreme's Server, BigCountry's [DEA] Clan Server - the same servers would also serve any other popular custom maps sprouting during those weeks, such as the well-received Towers map out mid-April. From same era (or even Beta like later Feb early March?!) Slicer lists 3 servers where him, BigCountry and Hydra are admins: PlanetDeusEx Conspiracy, NGUK Adv. Team Deathmatch, DEA.</p>
                        
                        <p>PlanetDeusEx Conspiracy (1109fm US) is hosted from  Seattle, USA, on port 7777, with following maps on its rotation: Area 51 Bunker, CMD, Silo, Cathedral, Skyline, Towers</p>
                        <p>Regarding DXMP population size, there are a few key points to consider: MP didn't ship with first disc; and those with internet connection were actively advised by community not to install the patch, so as to avoid SP bugs. These two major contributors out of the way, looking at the game running we see further challenges: </p>

                                        <q><p>There are a few bugs that we could use more information or some clarification on:</p>

                                                <li>There are reports of kick and kickban having problems. What problems are people experiencing? Or is this a problem not with the commands themselves but with when they can be used and who can use them?</li>
                                                <li>Can we get more information about the GPFs that people are experiencing? It seems they might be related to being hit with a GEP round while ADS is active -- are there other common occurances? Can we get crash dialog contents or logs from these?</li>
                                                <li>Is there any special formula for getting the "chicken dance" leaning insta-kill to happen?</li>
                                                <li>What is the exact behavior of the "vision aug doesn't work" bug? Must you be low in BE? Are you turning on other augs at the same time, or are they already on? Is the aug actually running (listen for the hum) but not displaying? How can you get vision working again: map transition? back to main menu? death? quit game and restart? reboot?</li>

                                                <li>Regarding vision aug not working for people at a distance, is this when looking through transparent surfaces like glass or chain link fences? Check if your crosshairs show the enemy -- if they do, but vision aug doesn't hilight them, let us know.</li></ul>

                                        <q><p>Thanks to everyone who's taken the time to give us feedback on the version of the Deus Ex multiplayer patch we released recently. (Yes, we even appreciate "constructive criticism," no matter how flame-like it may seem!)</p>
                                            <p>Let me set the record straight on a couple of things:</p>
                                            
                                            <p>We really do read these boards. We don't always respond and we almost never have the time to respond immediately. Unlike some other developers, we don't have a full-time customer service department here in Austin -- heck, we don't even have a biz guy or a marketing guy or a receptionist! Everyone in the building works on games which, as anyone in the biz will tell you, is a full-time job and doesn't leave a lot of time for BBS-browsing!</p>
                                            
                                            <div class="qhighlight">"As we said when we released the BETA version of the patch, we were counting on the community to use our SDK to generate all the new stuff"</div>

                                            <p>Someone recently posted that it would be futile to send us a letter outlining multiplayer problems, because the multiplayer team was already at work on DX2. That's true, to some extent. The multiplayer guys ARE all working on DX2 now and that's not going to change. What that means is that we're NOT going to create new maps, new game types, new player models and so on. That also means we're not going to address matters of personal opinion (e.g., weapon balance, augmentation strength, etc.). We like the patch the way it is now, and think it's a better multiplayer experience than it was before. We're reasonably certain you'll agree once you get over the shock of dealing with things that aren't the way they used to be. As we said when we released the BETA version of the patch, we were counting on the community to use our SDK to generate all the new stuff -- we just wanted to put an appropriate tool in their hands. We did that. (In fact, the recent SDK release fixed a bunch of stuff the mods guys told us was making it more difficult to generate new DX content.)</p>
                                            
                                            <p>So much for what we're NOT going to do. Are we just abandoning the community? No. Of course not. Let me assure you that we WILL look at any legitimate problem, and try to fix the serious ones. If something's broken, you bet we want to know about it and you bet we'll fix it, if we can. (That may mean releasing a patch for the patch -- aaiiieee! -- or it may mean another, updated version of the entire patch but, whatever it takes, we'll do what we can to fix things that are broken.)</p>
                                            
                                            <p>To fix things that are broken, we have to KNOW what's broken. We did a lot of testing (though the English language versions took a back seat to the foreign versions, the last month or so). Still, you guys are talking about stuff in your messages that we have no clue about:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>We need you to tell us what the "chicken dance" is.</li>
                                                <li>We need to know what you mean by "more GPFs," something we didn't encounter in our testing, which lasted more than ten seconds...</li>
                                                <li>We need to know which doors are broken for you.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p>If the letter you want to send gives us more data about these issues and other things that just don't work, send it. The sooner the better. Post messages providing as much information as possible about the problems you're having. But if you want to complain about weapon or augmentation balance issues, lack of new maps and new game types, features we should have added and so on, you're probably not going to be happy with our answer: We think the weapon and aug balance is better, don't have time to create new maps and game types and have included all the features we have time to implement. (Flame on!)</p>
                                            
                                            <p>So how are we proceeding?</p>
                                            
                                            <p>First, to increase the likelihood that we'll get the data we need to fix any problems in the multiplayer patch, our lead tester is going through every message on the DX BBS and pulling out information about things that are making the community unhappy.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>Second, the DXMP programming team is drafting a list of specific things they want more information about. Look for a message on the ION BBS shortly. Reply to it.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>Give us the data and we'll do our best to fix the problems.</p>

                            <p>Into summer 2001 NGUK was represented with 3 servers, admin team listed Isamu, Hydra, Pecker, Slicer, Face, the latter publishing enduring server rules list that allows us a glimpse into the challenges in server then: looking past the perpetual teamkilling issue and controversial spawnkilling topic, by 3rd point we arrive at game bugs. "Cabinet bug" is a ban worthy offense, I am guessing this one involves interacting with cabinet door as it is attempting to close(?) - either that or its running older patch even. Throwing knife refilling is a strongly enforced ban worthy offense, later decades see it as a feature, today a popular mod makes knives infinite so you don't even need to refill. Plasma (and other) weapons firing cheat/bug, is not clear to be what is meant here, perhaps some kind of timing skip akin to reload skipping. IDXL tournament rules from end of year forbids all cheating/bug abuse/client-side cheats, noting additionally that "Spawnkilling is discouraged but allowed. (Please do not fire WP/GEP into the hangar on a51, thats just lame)" and "Camping the level 2 cabinet on towers is also very lame, and we would suggest not doing it."</p><p>End of 2001 DEA server dominated USA scene by quality, Europeans behind IDXL claim 400-900 ping in DNA servers, DXL owning them claims pings are decent.</p>
                            
                            <p>[DEA] enjoyed a special role in the community as we get further into 2001, serving as the sort-of official Deus Ex forums through gamespy while waiting for Ion Storm boards to return, which they eventually did by the next year, alas without Multiplayer section.</p>
                            
                            <p>By July 6, 2001, competitive Finnish group [c]old that had now rebranded as [c]hevignon lists six best clans for a league his soon-clanmate TicTacToad[TN] is organizing: [TN] Thug Nation thats likely the largest clan then by members, [BK] Blitzkrieg that must be close in terms of members but likely stronger, [Y] Yakuza thats a more normal size group, [S] Stalkers that are now on verge of death and whose members would spill over to other clans within month plus, [DEA] that is entering its inactivity period due to Slicer quitting as leader on 9th and with lot of the original crew retired as Amigo also notes - BC would take over and theres still some two months until TonyMontana joins them, and finally the emergent [GDX] clan that has its roots in year 2000 clan (AU).</p>

                            <p>[c22]KingKai notes following week in May <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010622232010/http://pub58.ezboard.com/fc22clanfrm1.showMessage?topicID=75.topic" class="pagelink">2nd</a> that "Some times of the day nodoby's on DX online", other games taking interest. However, its at the time likely related to shock from weapon rebalance and bug fixes, and perhaps even more likely to the challenge of downloading and patching games and servers thus leading to incompatibilities.</p>

                            <p>With lack of a good server being the common culprit behind most failed clan wars, right behind getting team to show up at all, [c22]Jojo after a failed [TN] war shares some server hosting costs and requirements, mentioning costs of "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010727190232/http://pub58.ezboard.com/fc22clanfrm1.showMessage?topicID=102.topic" class="pagelink">60-70$</a> a month".</p>

                                        <q>Why do we continue to use the latest patches? Noone likes them, everyone I know likes the very first patch the best. There were no harmfull bugs in the 1st MP patch.

                                            <p>Now the doors are all messed up and you can get free stuff, the worst that could happen with the doors in the original was you could sneak some bio from the bots b4 the doors closed. Now there is this head shot bug! Which is the worst bug yet!!!!! There was no headshot bug in the original.</p>
                                    
                                            <p>Everyone liked the the origianl energy shield that actually did something. The plasma rifle is now virtually useless.</p>
                                    
                                            <p>Now it seems like all I do is go from cabinet to cabinet and bio bot to bio bot trying to keep my bio up, where as in the original patch, I would only need to use half the cells and hardly ever needed a bio bot.</p>
                                    
                                            <p>ADS seems to just get worse with every new patch, when I played with the original I never got killed from a gep if I had ADS on. Now it's like a chance thing, I get killed by about every 1 in 5 gep rockets shot at me.</p>
                                    
                                            <p>Now there is that skin swapping bug which is a real pain!</p>
                                    
                                            <p>There is also that door bug, where you blow up a door but you can still see it.</p>
                                    
                                            <p>And just this morning my little brother found a new bug that allows you to fire your guns under water!</p>
                                    
                                            <p>In the original the weapons were more powerfull, the shields worked much better, there wasn't a continual hunt for bio, the gameplay was faster, and there were no harmful bugs. The only thing that I see that is bad about the original is that the throwing knives are to strong.</p>
                                    
                                    So why do we still play with the latest bug filled patches when we could be playing with the original which has the least bugs, none of which are harmful!? I think that we should try to get all the servers to revert back to the original patch! If we could just get PDX and the NGUK servers to do it, I'm sure that the rest would follow!</q>

                                    <q>Deus Ex, Multiplaying game. What can I say about it? It's ain't doing very good. NGUK.net is now days only real server and there is too few admins and they can make invidual decisions, which isn't good because everyone knows almost everyone in DXMP and admins can make decisions, which aren't fair but are made by personal issues. There is also many bugs in latest DXMP patch and what I have heard there aren't made a new one. It's also very easy to cheat in DXMP thought there is some cheat protects. Luckily its easy to see if someone is cheating but how can you stop him because there never is a admin online. Someday it's gonna be get better but not for a while thought that's for sure. I myself am waiting for a new DXMP mod. Something like Counter Strike in Half Life but we'll see.</q>

                            </div>

                            <p>The skill gradient in DXMP was very wide as insane scores from screenshots of the likes of Beast had shown, quite different from ELO ranked and location locked servers of modern era they had a quality of their own in that being good meant ridiculous and satisfying KDR while those who were getting totally stomped probably didn't care at that point. Some players would really limit themselves to certain types of adventures in DXMP, running around with GEP Gun for years, for example, while others were just notoriously bad. But the time marches on and by July we already have new-old legends in the game that are turning heads: another [S] member is making headlines in the European community known as Amigo[s] on a 56k connection, interviewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010909134911/http://www.aperfectcircle.4t.com:80/interview.htm" class="pagelink">here</a> by the finnish [c] group for his new [ApC] clan he joined for the upcoming league organized by [TN][C]/[ApC]TicTacToad. The second known league to be organized after one [S]Hydra was planning, it would not be the last one - before end of year we see two: the largely DEA-focused smaller league of hardcore players called International Deus Ex League, and a much larger league organized by younger players thats simply called Deus Ex League which IDXL eventually also merges into. Like all DX leagues, it'll essentially be all talk and no games, wrapping up early next year. Another league supposedly organized by [EX] is currently unknown to me, but may have been 2002 continuation of the last one.</p>
                            <p>This epoch could be seen as having lasted another 3 months.</p>

                        <p>As Warren Spector said more than once that he expects the community to take the MP project off their hands, plenty were willing to try - and [S]Hydra started almost immediately from scratch - but just as him not many others knew how to. Warren said in another interview along the lines of that initially he didn't think releasing the SDK would do anything since they had a larger team working full time with those tools to produce the quality we're familiar with, but changed his mind after he saw what the Thief modding community could do once tools were released. Suffice to say, he knew what the community was up against. While I don't have good quotes at hand for this topic right now, it does seem that with the Deus Ex: Clan Wars idea - which later rebranded as Project Snowblind after DX2 failed - the team did plan to put some of what they learned into commercial use and potentially even within same franchise and following roughly same mechanics.</p>

                            <p>Among more competent up and coming coders were the Mod Loader team called Team UC with "campers" and "EdGann", but perhaps more relevantly RZU who took loader project over for MP, and the quite prolific DarksTalkeR behind DTR mods meant to augment the game in small ways. Talks of mutator support like in UT came up in threads about the Mod Loader, fourteenyearold TheRenegadeMaster - a name that will be relevant for us now - had spent preceeding half a year learning uscript and asking older coders for advice and inspiration, and another coder Nil asked community whether he should try to fix certain bugs. These two: the very social TRM who liked to organize things, and the very concrete and practical Nil, together form the backbone of the DXCBP team which stands for Deus Ex Community Based Patch. My understanding is that they opted for a very open-source and community-sourced approach with the project, as many others donated code and features, examples including PalmTree and TheSheep, but there were others.</p>
                            <p>Many small fixes and mods and coders would become characteristic of this period, but as BigCountry[DEA] already wrote to Ion Storm Austin workers on their forums: the bigger problem was a lack of servers and the difficulties hosting them, compared to other games. What may run 16 player Half Life server without a hitch could struggle to host 6 Deus Ex MP players. This would however mean that a dominant server such as [DEA] can pick their preferred coding team to work with to provide best patches possible to the most burning problems, regardless of what other servers do.</p>
                            <p>TRM got gradually better at coding and, as other modders exchanged ideas and help on the abundant forum places, various features started coming along for DXMP, but early into next year 2002 the team lost their heavy lifter Nil to life responsibilities. Hed return once more to do more coding from his vacation time off work around May 25, but all along this year another community patch the MTL had began to get attention. As is DXCBP philosophy, they merged to join forces on May 17, for the better of DXMP.</p>
                            <p>This period lasted some 8 months to a year.</p>

                    <div id="shortread"><p>Software Development Kit was released early for Deus Ex, and if you read the bits about Mod Loader and DTR then you know of community interest for mutator support - thus more dynamic, mutating MP features - that existed as long as any UT players tried DXMP out, so quite from the beginning. Certainly requests were made in January, but where Team UC and their Mod Loader project seemed to fade out not long after final patch, sometime late 2001 and certainly early 2002 Deus Ex MutaTator Loader or DXMTL for short appeared. It seemed to mainly be the product of coder called Smuggler, and unlike other mods it was very closed source - to a point where even decompiling it would not be of much use due to the level of obfuscation. This is already the kind of a mod you see for a competitive game.</p>                       
                    <p>While it appears that TRM hoped to incorporate MTL inside Community Based Patches, it ended up possibly the other way around. MTL loads mutators and smaller mods in, but limits the extent they can modify the game significantly by locking code down for security reasons. We can speculate that TRM was perhaps okay with the idea of future CBP features being loaded inside Mutator Loader, but what we know for sure is that the DXMP patching efforts culminated in the autumn this year 2002 with the September 2nd release of MTL152b1.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>While the CBP team with TRM at the helm certainly looked into the future hopeful, something happened as the year 2003 arrived. Everyone disappeared.</p>
                            <p>Without speculating there are little bits of information I can give you: two coders, one going under name Brina or Mimi decided to decompile MTL - seems they were fascinated by Unreal Engine but didn't even really play DXMP, later in 2004 justfying the act with the need to open closed source mod up for the community if the game is considered dead anyway. Particularly if the code wasn't Smuggler's. In the very same thread would re-surface already familiar Nil and calls Smuggler a fraud who stole code.</p>
                            <p>We know people asked around on forums Spring 2003 where did CBP disappear to, we know Nil had vanished and even TRM was surprised to see him in 2004, we know Smuggler was gone to never reappear again - at least not in our game. The story of what really happened seems to have gone with the time.</p>
                            <p>TRM suddenly appeared just to give the community a miniMTL, meant to fix some remaining annoying bugs like firing guns under water, but primarily targeting the ported Unreal Engine aimbot that was spreading in some circles. I know first hand that it stopped it only temporarily, were talking maybe months at most. And whats more interesting: the miniMTL was protected just as the main MTL mod had been, by my interpretation likely originating from or passing through the hands of the disappeared Smuggler.</p>
                            <p>I agree with Cozmo who is already a very seasoned coder in DXMP that MTL was both a blessing as well as a curse. Looking at what other people, both highly competitive augers as well as entirely modding focused community members have said before, it seems to be the common opinion. Regardless of who stole whose code or what the surrounding drama in the tiny team was, MTL was a phenomenal mod for the size of our community that was never outdone, yet one that also not only blocked further signficant mods but even blocked every player of non-English release from joining active servers.</p>
                            <p>In shape of MTL Extender by Nobody (De), and the E.d.H and DIOS clans by bunch of Spaniards, community found solutions to all problems except for the lack of players, and - for the longest time - to the frequent crashes to desktop.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Set DeusEx.exe to start as admin, to try and avoid numerous write access issues early, or with Steam library + Kentie's Deus Exe launcher combo r-click Deus Ex in games list and select properties, then add <em>-localdata</em> into the empty 'launch options' field to keep writable game files in classic location (Kentie will put them in your Documents folder otherwise).</p><p>If you want same functionality without Steam then just create or use a shortcut of DeusEx.exe and in the end of target field add -localdata<br />If theres any spaces in the path to deusex.exe then you gotta surround path part with quotes like this:<br /><em>"c:\program filez\Deus Ex\System\deusex.exe" -localdata</em><br /><br />Deus Ex will run totally fine with the files in Documents, but it may require additional steps at first like manually creating Cache folder or something annoying like that, downloading 0kb / zero-size cache files is also reoccurring problem then, so delete any you find.</p></li>

                        <li><p>📃 No Servers: open <em>DeusEx.ini</em> and Ctrl+F for 'masters', once you find [DeusEx.MenuScreenJoinGame] make sure the entire block looks like this:<br /></p><div class="selectall"><div id="quotecontainer"><div id="quotecontent"><em>[DeusEx.MenuScreenJoinGame]<br />MasterServerAddress=master.333networks.com</em></div></div></div><p>If that doesnt work at the time youre reading this, then refresh and give it a moment in case its lagging, after letting it through firewall, and if its totally dead then try adding this address into ini instead: master.deusexnetwork.com</p></li>

                        <li><p>🖱️ Mouse uncontrollable: for direct mouse control you'll want to follow instructions here <a href="https://kentie.net/article/dxguide/" class="pagelink">https://kentie.net/article/dxguide/</a> and ensure first checkbox with rawinput is selected (which it should be by default).</p> <p>For oldschool mouse feel you'll want <a href="http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html" class="pagelink">http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html</a> set up according to its instructions, but you should check above option first.</p><p>Additionally, force vsync off every way possible (gfx panel, ini settings) and make sure something like msaa fxaa isnt enabled for deus ex in graphics control panel, and that tvmonitor is in gaming mode. If your mouse is too slow to react and feels rubbery then you have some kind of input delay like vsync or other postprocessing, maybe even from monitor not being in gaming mode. If your mouse is skating on ice and going past target you have acceleration and your only fixes are some kind of app that adds raw input (such as Kentie's launcher or rinput) or to flatten acceleration inside windows itself with mousefix registry edits.</p></li>

                        <li><p>🖥️ Dark game: stock D3D will be dark these days, you'll get most accurate mouse aim if you follow instructions here: <a href="https://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/index.htm" class="pagelink">https://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/index.htm</a> - or if you really dont like it then try something from this page <a href="http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/" class="pagelink">http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/</a> after that select that renderer in launcher or in game and change renderer settings using in-game <em>preferences</em> command, or look for your renderer section in DeusEx.ini after you launched the game once with it (eg ctrl+f D3D10). VSync=Off and limit your framerate from here.</p></li>
                        <li><p>🗿 No players: you have to join groups on social media, for example the <a href="discord.gg/KUA8acb" class="pagelink"><img src="./img/1rzsfnwr.bmp" width="15px" height="15px" /> DXHQ</a> Discord server, or otherwise socialize with those who have the game. Self-sustained game died with GameSpy in 2014 so now your server list is the social media.</p></li>

                        <li><p>📃 Tip: although not so important these days, to view who is playing in servers and to enter passworded servers without console commands you can get DXMTL<em>152b1</em> from here <a href="https://www.deusexnetwork.com/files?q=mtl" class="pagelink">https://www.deusexnetwork.com/files?q=mtl</a>, manual one or installer.</p></li>

                        <li><p>📃 Tip: you'll need fixed engine.dll sooner or later to watch demo recordings so get it from here <a href="https://www.deusexnetwork.com/files?q=engine-dll" class="pagelink">https://www.deusexnetwork.com/files?q=engine-dll</a></p></li>

                        <li><p>🖥️ Tip: already briefly mentioned, but you should set up graphics profile for DeusEx.exe to make sure it runs with safe looking settings or set to application decides; very big laggers are vsync which should be forced off but also some anti-aliasing techniques like msaa that cause delay. The lower your monitor refresh the worse the effect is, that is to say the effect of vsync on a 60hz common monitor is very, very bad, effectively making you play like a noob.</p><p>On that note, use the highest refresh rate your monitor has for competitive gaming, but know that this engine cannot handle more than 200 fps. If you really want to use that 240Hz monitor then you can try it with CDX servers and maybe some future server patches, because although your game will still be a bit messed up the server on new patches wont be affected. Use renderer settings (eg under <em>[D3D10Drv.D3D10RenderDevice]</em> section I have this following line <em>FPSLimit=142</em>) in "preferences" or DeusEx.ini to cap fps, or if youre unable to get a hard cap then try launcher fps cap field - according to reports <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deus_Ex#Deus_Exe" class="pagelink">here</a> you should only use one FPS capping method at a time.</p></li>

                        <li><p>🖱️ Tip: set your mouse to 400dpi for snappy head aim, or not more than 800dpi for pro tier gaming; if you use raw input mode and pistol shots land ideally where you imagine they should land, the mode (and the mouse) probably works.</p></li>

                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: My game is sped up</div><div id="answer">A: Game FPS has to be 200 or less; try a new exe by Kentie or Hanfling, or avoiding them pre-win7 you might have to properly set deusex.exe to single core in task manager affinity setting</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I installed Kentie correctly but I crash to desktop with error when trying to join server</div><div id="answer">A: go to \Documents\Deus Ex\Cache\ folder, make sure that folder exists and its not read-only, then delete all 0kb empty files inside there and start deusex.exe with admin to try again</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I cant save game</div><div id="answer">A: not really MP issue but again check if you have 'Save' folder next to 'System' folder inside either \Documents\Deus Ex\ if you use launcher, or in directory where you installed the game - make Save folder manually if its not there and try again</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I want oldschool mouse feel back</div><div id="answer">A: oldschool mouse used a type of controllable 2X mouse acceleration, MarkC mousefix should be your solution, possibly with one of the imitate older OS settings; alternatively software like RawAccel might have config to imitate old games; Note: you NEED some fix anyway because Deus Ex enables EPP.</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I dont want mouse acceleration</div><div id="answer">A: You'll want proper Raw Input: Kentie's launcher has it for you, but alternatively there is software called RInput.exe used also in old UT community</div></div>

                            <div id="answer"><div>A: go through deusex.exe settings in gfx control panel and disable sus stuff or let app decide, set things to max performance; reduce quality in-game starting with going 16bit, trying lower res, D3D10 has best mouse but D3D9 exists; with Kentie's launcher use either renderer cap or launcher cap but not both; try fullscreen mode or borderless mode; as last straw disable frame limiters in game (D3D10 FPSLimit=0) and use nvidia framelimiter instead <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deus_Ex#Deus_Exe" class="pagelink">s</a>, possibly incurring small input lag.</div></div>
                        </div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Cursor is rubbery and lags</div><div id="answer">A: constant slight cursor lag is input lag - force vsync off for deusex.exe in gfx control panel and ini, disable FXAA, MSAA and such for it, set monitor to gaming mode / low latency mode, try disable any sort of syncs to see difference</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Servers are empty</div><div id="answer">A: find games on DXHQ Discord server on #multiplayer channel and social media</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: There are no servers</div><div id="answer">A: either you didn't add new masterserver from above to your deusex.ini properly, or it just happens to lag - give it a minute or even two after refreshing it, its not normal but sometimes it can be laggy like its getting ddosed</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Game is too dark</div><div id="answer">A: on windows some old renderers are now darker than originally intended, either manually crank up gamma or do what others do and get one of the custom ones - Dohnal ones can get stuck with bright gamma but you can reset that bug with gammareset.exe by Jonas on moddb (although it might get flagged by defender)</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Desktop gamma messed up after exiting game</div><div id="answer">A: renderers by Chris Dohnal can have this problem after game crash; it can be fixed by resetting your gfx global/gamma settings, but moddb also has old fix for it called gammareset.exe; D3D10 could offer better accuracy however</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Game settings dont save</div><div id="answer">A: Kentie launcher uses ini files in your Documents Deus Ex now; setting commands from game menu or using 'preferences' from there is an alternative to editing .ini files manually as most of us do; can make sure they arent read-only</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I dont want to use ini files in Documents</div><div id="answer">A: start kentie's launcher with -localdata parameter, you can add it to shortcut or Steam, google how to start games with parameters/arguments especially in Steam; btw -skipdialog ignores launcher menu going right into game</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: sound is crackling bad in-game</div><div id="answer">A: it is not good sign of game performance but you can fix this specific issue by slightly increasing audio latency in launcher, ie to 50, but odds are some other compatibility or gaming setting might also fix it</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I have some other weird issues in Windows</div><div id="answer">A: look into compatibility options in deusex.exe properties, particularly try disabling Fullscreen Optimizations to see if anything happens, or try different computer or operating system for comparison and to isolate the issue</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Linux?</div><div id="answer">A: works fine for playing, install it through Steam with Proton enabled on it in its settings, wayland might have input lag but check settings in compositor to fix it or look for updated gfx drivers</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Mac?</div><div id="answer">A: using Wine is your only option, google how others have done it (helps even if they are going modded), reportedly works fine but I cannot comment on competitive performance without trying it myself</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Problems with demorec playback</div><div id="answer">A: deusex.log tells you what packages demo map needs and you need them in cached form or correctly installed on your pc; engine.dll fix helps with most crashes; if demo seems sped up you can use demoplay filename?timebased</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Demorec still crashes before playing</div><div id="answer">A: if youve followed all obvious and suggested fixes and it still crashes then you might be out of luck, can try different installation with only required packages and nothing else, and if file is big enough to contain something then hold on to it</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: GPFs or General Protection Faults</div><div id="answer">A: in demo you can get past it with some luck but it can take lot of attempts, screencap it; in game you need newer server patch, particularly ANNA, CDX, maybe some miniMTL versions help; can try reinstall your game and tweak compat</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I can't get cool symbols to show properly in ini</div><div id="answer">A: save user.ini as 'all files' format UTF-8 for example, instead of ANSI or what its default is</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I can't hear some sounds and get massive lag</div><div id="answer">A: type in command netspeed 20000 or you can check its value with stat net, if its some small number like 1600 or 2400 then its your problem, netspeed 20000 sets it to max - thats 20k (your ping can also show much higher with this issue)</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: I cant find some ini settings ie for renderer</div><div id="answer">A: if you check those settings from game menu by using preferences command then they can appear in your ini as intended, run deusex.exe as admin to avoid various such issues and remove read-only from game folders and files</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: My settings reset next map</div><div id="answer">A: setting your settings during match might not save properly to ini file and its fairly common issue, try above suggestions for permission setting and make your edits from game menu preferences or manually from the ini files</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Hosting server?</div><div id="answer">A: if it doesnt show up then you need to open ports for deus ex server; on linux you might need GUI; with kentie you might need old exe to get -server to work, research what patches you need and how to create .bat for them, or whether anyone plays it</div></div>
                        <div id="questionAnswerPair"><div id="question">Q: Do I have to reinstall if I have messed up ini or got some mysterious problem like renderer stopped working?</div><div id="answer">A: Before reinstalling the game you can always try moving away or deleting your User.ini and DeusEx.ini files, so move them to desktop so you can salvage binds later or just get rid of them - game will always make new User.ini and DeusEx.ini for you as long as you dont mess with Def files.</div></div>

                    <p>As evident from the many wonderful videos players have uploaded, DXMP is an action-packed and fast-paced experience of big risks and bigger rewards, with phases of domination and periods of struggle. While veterans are used to all of the game quirks, when it comes to the new blood there are two kinds of beginner players: The Tourist, and the Man With the Plan.</p>
                    <p>The Tourist packs his GEP gun and Jedi sword into his waist pounch and goes for a stroll, exploring the map and taking in the scenery - sounds really idyllic but perhaps misplaced, since the augmented killing machines zooming around make it definitely the wrong neighbourhood for a casual walk.</p>
                    <p>The Man With the Plan however is already familiar with Deus Ex concepts of skill levels, its weapons, augmentations, and with useful guides and thanks to helpful friends has already set up his hotkeys. He spawns on the map with pre-planned augmentations, selects weapons of choice for easy kills, and upgrades skills that support his battle strategy. When streaked psychos show up to slurp up his corpse for that vital bio energy our hero has already long vanished without a trace, now preparing, evolving, looking for his chance to dominate the scene.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="decoratedHeader"><div class="deco"><div class="lineRight"></div><div class="lineLeft"></div></div><div id="h3">Basics</div><div class="deco"><div class="lineRight"></div><div class="lineLeft"></div></div></div>
                <div id="chapter">
                    <div class="p">Skills:<br /><div class="emphasis">You have enough skill points to upgrade 1 weapon skill once or 2 support skills once, thus bringing them to the medium level. Or you can upgrade 1 support skill twice, maxing it out completely.</div>For a very specific strat you can move towards maxing one skill, particularly if its something like DXMP_Smuggles and the idea is to soak up tons of damage with maxed Medicine and medbots nearby - or to hack that turret fast with Computers. For a more general play I would recommend spreading support skills out more and take that risk of picking or tooling a tiny bit longer - without upgrades those actions can amount to an unacceptable risk, but a single upgrade turns it around completely. Upgrade weapon skills early only if you know you have free bio and plan to get easy kills.<br /><br />
                    Environmental skill (6) is not used in classic DXMP, the rest should be self-explanatory. Crossbow is a pistol-class weapon and historically nobody uses defensive aug against its poison.</div>
                    <div class="p">Augmentations:<br /><div class="emphasis">You have 2 augmentations of your choice, chosen in order they are shown in Multiplayer menu starting from top. Unless you're cooking something very specific it is advisable to always pick Speed Enhancement first. Second augmentation depends, but you cant really go wrong with <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" data-placement="top" title="<div class='tooltipFormattedBorder'>Even if you're dueling someone using vision, you can get out of range, force him to waste bio, and generally troll around with a more benefitial aug than if you both had vision.</div>">Cloak</span>.</div>Often you find yourself moving augmentations up or down the priority list depending on what the opponent is doing, so its important to familiarize yourself with their features, but its also completely okay to build your playstyle around one priority list of augs and simply pick your fights according to it: with cloak you want some extra cheesy first kill since besides some invisibility - and being a speedy bro in general - you dont have anything specifically defensive available to counter damage types. Get that kill and you now have two defensive augs. With something like Bally which is a super common second slot aug you want to avoid rockets and shells long enough to kill something, and same principle with plasma and explosive damages, EMP.<br /><br />What different augmentations do should be clear from their descriptions, but Energy Shield also defends against LAM, LAW, HE20 explosions. High energy drain augs like vision and speed should only be very briefly toggled on in desperate need. PR is vulnerable against LAMs and DTS.</div>
                    <div class="p">Weapons:<br /><div class="emphasis">Some good options on the rack from every weapon class: GEP against anyone without ADS, pistol for those with good head aim, rifles for various ranges, and DTS is OP throughout game. Picking GEP and Assault Rifle, you can equip them with more powerful ammunition found elsewhere in containers you need to unlock. Some maps may also have a free explosive grenade LAM placed somewhere, but there are certainly some in lockers scattered around.</div>Each weapon has their pattern to adjust to as well as effective range and countering defensive augs. You cant go wrong with using GEP gun on people who dont have streak shown on scoreboard, very rarely it is picked on spawn, but shooting it near any opponent with ADS running you can damage your torso making it yellow. DTS can take some practice to get good with, but result is worth it. Assault group rifles are most effective close range.<br /><br />Sniper rifle does practically no damage without Zoom, and double damage to head. At beginning use it for very long range or better dont use it at all.</div>

                <div id="chapter">
                    <p>Before we even mention playing you have to fix some buttons for MP that were never properly set up by devs. Open your <em>User.ini</em> file and find <em>[Extension.InputExt]</em> section for multiplayer buttons: we are going to plan out your keys now and add them there.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Talk - move 'talk' and 'teamtalk' buttons somewhere else, I use Numpad 3 &amp; 6, otherwise you probably die locked into chat more often than you'd like.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Heal HP - if you have a favourite button for healing stuff, find it and make it look like my button F= here: F=<em>ParseRightClick|ParseRightClick|MedBind|OnRelease ActivateBelt 2</em><br />It puts away anything blocking healing, then looks for commands under an alias MedBind that you dont have yet, then takes out weapon in second slot. Instead of this long line you can also put here simply ActivateBelt 9</p></li>

                        <li><p>Heal Energy - now find 2nd such key for healing - this time your bio energy, and modify it to look like my Alt= button: Alt=<em>ParseRightClick|ParseRightClick|BioBind|OnRelease ActivateBelt 2</em><br />Working identically to the above heal bind it wont actually heal unless we scroll down to our <em>Aliases</em> lines and modify some empty line with value None to look like these two, in my case 18th and 19th alias were empty:<br /><em>Aliases[18]=(Command="ActivateBelt 9|onRelease ParseLeftClick",Alias=MedKit)<br />Aliases[19]=(Command="ActivateBelt 0|onRelease ParseLeftClick",Alias=BioCell)</em></p></li>

                        <li><p>Mouse - make sure you have ToggleScope on a good button, modern games use RMB but I understand if you like it on the keyboard, I kinda miss having it there for relaxed hand, and for item pickup I use Wheel, so the relevant buttons for me are:<br /><em>RightMouse=ToggleScope<br />MouseWheelDown=parserightclick<br />MouseWheelUp=parserightclick</em></p></li>

                        <li><p>Sprint - or real name <em>Speed Enhancement</em>: find your next most comfortable button thats still free for MP and make it look like my E= button here: E=<em>DualMapF7</em><br />Its an odd one because the paired aug doesnt need any button, while this one needs the best button you got, but you'll want it set.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Bullet Shield - or real name <em>Ballistic Protection</em>: next key you add is DualMapF6 for ballistic protection, i use Q so it looks like this: Q=<em>DualMapF6</em></p></li>

                        <li><p>Rocket Shield - or real name <em>Aggressive Defense System</em>: key value is DualMapF9 for aggressively defending against flying rockets, I use R so it looks like this R=<em>DualMapF9</em></p></li>

                        <li><p>Heal Regen - or real name <em>Regeneration</em>: next you want healing(!) aug key DualMapF4 and since I use X it looks like this: X=<em>DualMapF4</em></p></li>

                        <li><p>Blast Shield - or real name <em>Energy Shield</em>: to protect against grenade explosions and plasma attacks you want DualMapF3 and my C button looks like this: C=<em>DualMapF3</em></p></li>

                        <li><p><em>EMP Shield</em> - mainly against the EMP grenades but also the odd drone, I use Z with DualMapF5 so it looks like this: Z=<em>DualMapF5</em></p></li>

                        <li><p><em>Cloak</em> - or <em>Vision</em>, regardless you need good button for DualMapF8 that you click a lot, for me currently its <em>Unknown05=DualMapF8</em> which is a mouse sidebutton enabled by Kentie, but I've tried to use pipe/backslash also Backslash=DualMapF8</p></li>

                        <li><p><em>Run Silent</em> - but we are not done yet: Run Silent is next tier gaming and throws enemy off big time, but itll never be among your top priorities, I use N so it looks like this: N=<em>DualMapF10</em></p></li>

                        <li><p><em>Aqualung</em> - similar logic as above and not every map has water unfortunately, I use V so it looks like this: V=<em>DualMapF11</em></p></li>

                        <li><p><em>Light</em> - most important aug, no matter your score or server, you'll always have your trusty light aug, M button for me so its like this: <em>M=dualmapf12</em> (however bear in mind if you can see the light around you then so can enemy, even through walls)</p></li>

                        <li><p><em>Buy Skills</em> - to quickly upgrade skills in a fight just copy and paste these number buttons into your ini:</p><div class="selectall"><div id="quotecontainer"><div id="quotecontent">9=BuySkills|ActivateBelt 9|OnRelease ActivateBelt 9<br />5=buyskills|activatebelt 5<br />6=buyskills|activatebelt 6<br />7=buyskills|activatebelt 7<br />8=buyskills|activatebelt 8<br />4=ActivateBelt 4<br />3=ActivateBelt 3<br />2=ActivateBelt 2<br />1=ActivateBelt 1<br />0=BuySkills|ActivateBelt 0|OnRelease ActivateBelt 0</div></div></div>And copy these Function button values also:<div class="selectall"><div id="quotecontainer"><div id="quotecontent">F1=BuySkills|ActivateBelt 1|OnRelease ActivateBelt 1<br />F2=BuySkills|ActivateBelt 2|OnRelease ActivateBelt 2<br />F3=BuySkills|ActivateBelt 3|OnRelease ActivateBelt 3<br />F4=BuySkills|ActivateBelt 4|OnRelease ActivateBelt 4</div></div></div><p>The number on number row or function row corresponds to the skill in buyskill menu, so there shouldn't be anything confusing. Its possible to make double-upgrade binds for half-cost skills but I don't recommend them.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Misc buttons - my switch ammo is on Tab so it looks like this: Tab=switchammo<br />I use L for DropItem personally but default should be MiddleMouse which is totally fine by me so go with either, the default: MiddleMouse=DropItem<br />Useful for checking your lags is a string of commands I put behind my Comma button, so like this: Comma=Stat Net|Stat FPS<br />Feigning dead can have various purposes, here on my numpad . it looks like this: NumPadPeriod=FeignDeath<br />Capslock is a nice big button but annoying for chat, so I put toggle score on it: CapsLock=showscores<br />Some servers have map vote window you can bring up: Backspace=mutate mapvote<br /></p></li>

                        <li><p>Personal choices: I use Shift for crouching, so it looks like this: Shift=duck<br />I also like having lockpick and multitool closer to me but you might find better use for those specific buttons, so my lockpick looks like: <br />t=activatebelt 7<br />And my multitool looks like: Ctrl=ActivateBelt 8<br />Similarly I brought gas closer to fingertips since Im not happy with belt button 6 for it, so G for grenade it looks like this: G=activatebelt 6</p></li>
                    </ul>																								
                    <p>Tips: think through your own buttons logically like this, step by step, your muscle memory will get used to them fast so find some method to this madness before you discover you need to make changes - best starting point is to find parallels with functions from other games youre used to; prioritize buttons you need to click a lot, ie DualMapF7.</p>
                    <p>Tips: look for any good unused buttons for functions you want to add, in my example above I have not used the second mouse side button, and my choices for "T" and "Ctrl" could likely be decided better by you.</p>
                    <p>Tips: its possible to bind multiple augmentations to a button, and depending on your experience and preferences you may use some of them, starting with ActivateAllAugs I think it was called, which you can find in game menu, and similarly DeactivateAllAugs that I used until recently and then removed. It is better to build skill with individual or combo aug binds than toggle everything once, although sometimes called the panick button. Note that there is minute difference in the sounds different grenades make even if you cant see them, but some people do bind temporary shields such as EnergyShield + EMP Shield to same button, which would then look like this: button=<em>DualMapF3|DualMapF5</em><br />Also very common is to bind weapon damage augmentations to mouse fire, like Targeting (so bullet shield button) or Combat Strength (your blast shield button) being chained something like this in case of knifing strats: LeftMouse=ParseLeftClick|Fire|DualMapF3<br />If you start adding functions to mouse fire however then you might need to bind some command to change its functionality depending on your style. (Edit: at time of writing I don't know how to exec-bind complex leftmouse functionality, so bindkey LeftMouse ParseLeftClick|Fire|ToggleCombat - where ToggleCombat is already defined alias of ActivateAugmentation 0|OnRelease ActivateAugmentation 0 - does work if I manually type it, but not if I try to exec it from bindaug files or elsewhere, instead just binding first element ParseLeftClick and stopping at pipe.)</p>
                    <p>Tips: more advanced territory is binds to change aug prefs and you can create variety of layouts based on this typical vision rifler setup were going to make now, so create new text file in game system folder and name it something like vision.txt or speedtank or whatever, then open it and paste the following inside it, then save it (this is dependent on MTL):<br /></p><div class="selectall"><div id="quotecontainer"><div id="quotecontent">BindAug 0 AugSpeed<br />BindAug 1 AugBallistic<br />BindAug 2 AugDefense<br />BindAug 3 AugHealing<br />BindAug 4 AugVision<br />BindAug 5 AugShield<br />BindAug 6 AugEMP<br />BindAug 7 AugStealth<br />Bindaug 8 AugAqualung<br />BindAug -1</div></div></div><p>Then find some yet unused button in your user.ini like something on the numpad and make it look like this: NumPad5=exec vision.txt</p>
                    <p>Even more advanced and potentially unhealthy is to change your game conf constantly depending on style or even weapon, for example you can daisy-chain fov command after a weapon, using pipe symbol as youve seen already, so something like 2=activatebelt 2|fov 120<br />I don't really recommend it although Ive actually used it longer period of time at some point, that fov can glitch out and in general its best to be used to certain depth in my opinion. Another such setting that can be added or used instead of fov is mouse sensitivity, so something like this: 2=activatebelt 2|fov 120|setsensitivity 1.59<br /> Once again, although I have used it and there is a strong case to be made for speeding up the heavy weapons, I think having a constant mouse speed that you are used to is better.<br />When we get to the territory of binding things to our fire key, ideal would be to have it in the respective style .txt sheets but they dont seem to work from there so you'll probably have to type it in: bindkey LeftMouse ParseLeftClick|Fire|DualMapF6|OnRelease DualMapF6<br />And for any other non-targ or non-cs style you want default mouse back so enter command: bindkey LeftMouse ParseLeftClick|Fire</p>
                    <p>Note that there are 3 categories of names for augmentations: classic activateaugmentation akin to activatebelt, the MTL-introduced dualmap, and the class name Aug</p>

                <div id="chapter">
                        <p>You can learn to play in Basic variants but ultimately all your skill is tested in Advanced, particularly in the ATDM. Game also has variety of different custom modes but you wont need most of your binds there - in 0a just use medbind and play with rifles and pistol.</p>
                        <p>Startup augs often mean Speed aug or Cloak - or both - as without streak you are super-vulnerable and ready for picking. The more aggressive players might go with speed + some defensive shield depending on what enemy is doing, typically Bally but might need ADS or even Energy shield.</p>
                        <p>Plan is to kill someone using some kind of advantage, without upgrades your weapons are weaker so using Heavy class on other unstreaked players can be a quick way to gain upper hand even with rifle play - just pick your place and method and dominate the opponent. Look for weaker opponents first.</p>
                        <p>Goal is to stay alive, in a sense that can be more important than a lot of frags because not dying means you carry streak of advantages for you and your team both; together you want to find an advantage over the enemy team, and keep that advantage to yourself entire map, denying enemy the score.</p>
                        <p>Maps have a variety of loot with locations you need to discover and memorize, especially freebies; holding turret areas can also decide the fate of the game. With loot you need to strike a balance between farming and surviving, because if you die carrying a lot of stuff then you got it for enemy.</p>
                        <p>Skills at startup really depend on your plan and your map, maybe you want to get turret fast, or maybe your goal is locked behind keypad or mechanical lock, or maybe youll go right after enemy. Remember just 'cause you can max cheaper skill doesnt mean you have to, in fact I'd recommend you upgrade two different skills instead - and make it count.</p>
                        <p>Try to support your team but dont lose focus of your solo play or you might get killed staring at your own team; try not to kill teammates although in mass fight it may yield your team a streak.</p>

                <div id="chapter">
                    <p>Preparations before leaving spawn:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select 'Speed Enhancement' as one of your top two augs, and make the other one 'Cloak', or for a very aggressive play you can pick something else here.</li>
                        <li>Pick up 'Assault Shotgun', 'Dragon Tooth Sword', 'GEP Gun' for example weapons to practice, or something of your choice is also fine as long as you focus.</li>
                        <li>Upgrade 'Lock Picking' and 'Medicine', or if current map doesn't have much interesting behind manual locks then go with 'Multitooling' or even 'Computers'.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <P>Leave spawn and practice:</P>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Toggle Speed Enhancement on in short bursts to practice big *jumps* and just bounce around map geometry for fun, DXMP_Silo is ideal map for it.</li>
                        <li>Add to the above practice controlled shots or swings from your chosen lighter weight weapon, and keep bouncing and calmly firing at things.</li>
                        <li>Take an occasional pause to briefly equip 'GEP Gun' and fire at something, especially if there are other players you can try kill them with it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You're probably out of bio energy by now and are starting to get the idea, so lets proceed to learn the map:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put GEP away, throw it if you want to save time, and look for loot on the map: you want to first find and remember all the *free stuff* there.</li>
                        <li>While free stuff will influence what skills you pick, odds are someone already took your goodies so go learn where all the *locked things* are.</li>
                        <li>Try do the looting and exploration with 'Cloak' aug enabled but stay away from enemy sound range and crosshair, some might also have Vision aug.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can practice these elements of speed movement and precise hits and map looting, cloak favors looting and ambush so if you want to do more shooting instead then just move 'Ballistic Protection' above Cloak in priorities, or some other shield that counters what opponent is doing.</p>
                    <p>Decent chance that with the above you've already managed to streak up and doubled your augmentations, but lets get down to business starting from afar:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With GEP you want to keep some distance and target those with 0 streak on scoreboard, with a LAM you mightve found by now you want to predict and bounce it.</li>
                        <li>Similarly you can surprise and sting from a distance using powerful alt-ammo youve found like the 'HE20' for rifle or 'WP' for GEP, maybe even try a bazooka.</li>
                        <li>Your Cloak ambush can be further enhanced with cleverly planted grenades, also take ownership of Turret some point soon and use it as your bodyguard.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Playing from distance like that can be extremely effective and good on your score, but to streak up from close you'd practice the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee - when you spot your victim try to use element of surprise and quickly put precise shots into same hitbox region.</li>
                        <li>Learning weapon shot patterns and timing you want to go for head very close up or pure torso if head isnt working out, practice quick DTS kills unupgraded.</li>
                        <li>You can combine these high damage weapons with grenade traps you or someone has set, and perhaps even try a pistol if you are good with them in other games.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now that you can find loot, bounce, and get streaks, its time to learn how to dominate the enemy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid dying, your streak is more important than a risky fight, maintain a constant supply of at least some heals, restocking when low but not feeding enemy.</li>
                        <li>Take all turrets with team and help them wipe out any stray opponents asap, take fights on your terms and to your preferred locations, trapping opponents.</li>
                        <li>Spam weakened respawning enemy with massive damage and take map resources including heal bots before them, maintain permanent BP and ADS keeping ES ready.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sometimes it is better to just kill the enemy instead overthinking it, just remember to keep your advantage youve worked for. Build up your game and have fun.</p>
                    <p>If you cannot focus on your weapon fire and survival anymore then theres a good chance its time to take a break or radically change strats.</p>

                        <p>At the time of writing the community plays the most popular gametype variants, you may just show interest towards Advanced match or 0a match and it can contribute towards whats in the schedule soon. More niche requests may take a while longer to set up and may not have maximum amount of people, but with the right organizing everything is possible.</p>
                        <p>DXMP has gone through variety of paradigm shifts and currently we play without weapon accuracy mechanics, because current alternatives have broken game speed and that is somehow even less desirable. Technically ANNA's FPS scoreboard and Kai's netspeed mutator combo can keep lot of the problem in check, which may be valuable information to those who want to host original DXMP.</p>
                        <p>Our focus does tend to be on ATDM or more rare ADM, since its the game type that makes DXMP stand out the most, however all of the active players are experienced in 0a scene as well and may wish to relive that experience.</p>
                        <p>In 2020s we are happy with 6-8 players in regular matches during activity spikes, but potential for 14-16 is there, going even over the max capacity of some main servers during some rare events.</p>
                        <p>Continent that the match takes place on also depends on current trends and moods, on who is organizing and who is playing; with CDX specifically you'll perhaps find cross-continent play more enjoyable, allowing even Asians and Australians play somewhat competitively in Europe and US.</p>

                        <p>Information presented on the site is meant to be historically accurate and factual, it is however recommended to use the abundant linked sources to form your own opinion on the matters. Clans and their story involve a lot of data that may now be available only through the perspectives of biased parties, and often people forget the specifics of their own events in a matter of few months. This all means that corrections to this resource will likely be perpetual, and that what you see is my best interpretation based on covered available material.</p>
                        <p>To issue corrections or just any material and factual information that you can share on a clan you can just e-mail it, the address to do so is synthetic.dx@gmail.com <br /><br />The more creative interpretations will find their appreciation on stories page, or at best in the background field, the rest should remain factual.</p>
                        <p>Clan list is focused on showcasing and telling the story of various Tags without much discrimination between their success, size, longevity, era. Some of the strongest clans lived mere days or weeks, and some of the longest-living clans were not very strong - I think both are important parameters, and I also don't want to neglect tags that represent other types of groups in the game.</p>
                        <p>First tags were added from known and listed clans while unknown tags were not added, last additions to this list come from unknown tags in screenshots and the work is still ongoing. You can assume that the significant clans all have made it into the list by now, but probably many dozens of short-lived tags are missing. Hasharin, whose work is now incorporated in here, has used similar sources but thats all I know - somehow he obtained over a hundred clans that I've never seen, possibly through his server that catered to a unique subcommunity of non-English players, and back then with a better access to now dead forums. If Japanese community alone was able to roll out some 5 or more tags, then it is not unthinkable that every other player with a non-English copy of Deus Ex could collectively bring about a hundred or more.</p>
                        <p>Sorting and filtering the list may discard many lesser known clans due to lack of data until resolution improves and the gaps get filled in: rosters and clan wars are currently incredibly incomplete thus sorting by them is more of a novelty rather than good statistics. The game types field is very sporadically filled and largely from an experienced guess, while I could also randomly guess the other clans depending on their era I prefer not to do so until I have better evidence of their strength.</p>

                <div id="chapter"> 
                    <div id="shortread">
                        <p>Main criteria for the clan list is that a tag existed at a time and was thus promoted, somewhat separating it from very impromptu troll tags but indeed including few social and joke clans - clan is a clan.</p>
                        <p>Game was officially online from December 2000 to end of May 2014 - we witnessed some inertial activity to the end of that year, but thereafter all the games were organized on social media; while most had access to the new server list and the addition of new players to the competitive scene was already negligible, the combination of a <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" data-placement="bottom" title="<div class='tooltipFormatted'>Game- and weapon fire speed varied from player to player</div>">critically bugged game</span> and the formal death of the serverlist provided regulars the reason to finally retire.</p>
                        <p>In the event that some of the currently (2023) live links go down, you can attempt to resurrect them yourself with something like https://web.archive.org - as I understand, other crawlers are donating to Archive.org as well, so results may improve in future.</p>
                        <p>I save the dead links partly because I only rely on archive.org and do not use any other tools that may emerge in the future, and partly because there is some information even in the plain address or in the existence of it.</p>
                        <p>Forum links to Invisionfree that got taken over by Tapatalk has led to breaking original formating, but that only concerns live forums still functional today.</p>
                        <p>I would like to categorize clans according to the skill, assuming intermediate has no problem beating beginner and top clan has no problem beating intermediate, plus to separate out social tags - currently marked as Superb, Advanced, Beginner tier, I think this is an accurate representation of clan evolution based on my own experience in dozens of matches. I've made abundant guesses in the list to get the table to sort better, but have started to assign more tiers not only to indicate evolution but also skill - or guess - range. Wide range of levels makes particular sense with top first month clans of the game who are clearly better than anyone else yet were certainly learning the game only weeks ago, and also you can expect to see many tiers assigned to clans that have been around and matured for decades. Assigning Basic tier to clans that are unheard of and relating to BTDM or 0aug communities seems like a safe bet until more information surfaces. Because the tiers assigned here are not directly tied to any metric - such as war stats that are scarce in DXMP - and can be debated to some extent, then you can also just ignore them - they exist only to give you some kind of idea of clan's position, and like everything else here it may be incorrect.</p>
                        <p>Marked gametype has to be a combination of clan Focus and accepted Wars, regardless of what individual members might've played on their own initiative; what type of server the clan hosted is likely a sufficient identifier.</p>
                        <p>As it has been decades since these links were last live, assume that everything is archived; fully functional websites at this point are extremely rare - the archiver is however able to play some flash content now and they appear to be developing it further, in other cases you might be able to just download them and find own solution.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>28.03.24 - Decision has been made to remove any contact and other personal information from files, data previously there to help public to connect to and recognize old friends via the largely expired 20+ years old addresses, and that aided me in a mountain of duplicate players. I even saw a case where such details heplped their owner attempt to recover forgotten account, but in spite of it all being once-public information, in hindsight it seems to severely conflict with the personal data security expectations of modern day as well as with the general desire for anonymity displayed by the majority of the very community this site is dedicated to. A notable exception will be made only for the very approximate birthyears: in DXMP everyone is a celebrity and guessing the age is a thing we do with celebrities.<br /><br />On that topic, the oldest DXMP player kids had heard of back in day was the ole Dammit who even had his website age adjusted to "Very Old!" at some point. Rumored to be 50-60 years old, in reality he hadnt even entered his 40s yet, the author here will be catching up in a couple and certainly has someone to raise a toast to.</li>
                            <li>26.03.24 - With a very heavy heart I've for time being re-adjusted one clan's ranking, unfortunately if any skilled clan forms and proceeds to beat you in a war then that is not S tier, although these tiers here are not an exact science and you can expect similar adjustments in future with goal to reflect the real balance better.<br /><br />On a lighter note, thank the heavens for tags in parentheses that make marking tiers so much easier.</li>
                            <li>26.03.24 - We are approaching 50% complete at a fairly decent (available) resolution, but a growing list of deeper clan content is added to the future tasks. A higher priority is placed on first year clans, as I think they interest everyone more, myself included. This list is coming along so much more accurate and improved that the old google sheets will likely be taken offline after this site is complete.<br /><br />Also note how our homeboy Hasharin is single-handedly 1/3 of the entire game, keeping Basic in tight race with other dominant scenes.</li>
                            <li>28.02.24 - A more thorough implementation of Clan News and deeper pass has to wait for better times (plan A). Similarly, migrating clans in chronological order (plan B), for a better resolution and to correct the plenty mistakes, has made it to [DU] but also has to be put on hold. Moving old content as-is (plan C) with fixes only to the errors I catch on the go is the current goal. At 5% migration complete. <br /><br />Meanwhile, laugh at this badboy bringing us all the early clans of DXMP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010921183642/http://pub50.ezboard.com:80/fsclansbsboardfrm2?page=2" class="pagelink">here</a></li>
                            <li>17.02.2024 - Timeline page concept meant to visually bring you the conversations and activity of certain eras has largely finalized for time being. It stemmed from already having my own links to archived content that I then wanted to share, and as it predominantly deals with very early days then it should also spark greater interest in wider range of audience. I've attempted to bring you most important posts first, ideally all DXMP related posts, and sometimes web pages if I had time - there is always a link to both forums and sites in the header for you to check yourself, one of the main purposes of Timeline is that you wouldn't have to.</li>
                            <li>16.01.2024 - Discovered file with forum and website links to many dead urls, now added with wayback machine back into clanlist (originally in 2005 I didnt preserve url if I couldnt access site)</li>
                            <li>30.06.2023 - I added Generation Triad along with its available stats and infos; also added several unknown clans from 2006 (VTG, dB', SA, Op, IA, AI, D0D, ni, TMX, DXBC); found nMe and other lost links</li>
                            <li>2023: I have Founders and Leaders a bit mixed up here and there, mainly because listed leaders were not always the founders, in other cases founder wasn't even in the clan anymore - guess I'll distinguish them with a note.</li>
                            <li>2023: I've had to make some changes to list to get sorting to work properly, notably inserting January if we only know the year, or Jan-July-Dec for early, mid, late year scope; italic denotes just a guess while in bold is the certain and verified date.</li>
                            <li>2023: the links are now fixed and clan list is filled with additional information.</li>

                            <li>"EgoTc" - eGo clan has additional tag TC later on - seen on their forum link - which is either a clan merge or a tag change, but unable to confirm its from a separate clan I am not adding it to the list.</li>
                            <li>GD - likely a counter-strike clan with no presence in DXMP; Unknown clan of unknown game https://web.archive.org/web/20040405075017/http://theinformant.jaywebdesigns.com:80/ben/ (recruiting at least Cal-M (Laggyspizzle from google: "Rankings went cal-o, cal-im, cal-m, cal-p, cal i. Anyone could join o, and moving up in leagues was based on performance at the end of the season. Cal-i was mostly just pros."))</li>
                            <li>Eqm? - https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/http://phpbb-host.com/phpbb/index.php?mforum=eqmclan - I wonder if its some clan idea I had in 2005; I may have stumbled across my own Equilibrium clan idea since I was quite impressed by the movie of same name then, but aside toying with forums I never "committed" to starting the clan up and likely never wore the tag - if I had one. Probably sat in my 2005 bookmarks backup.</li>
                            <li>/KOW\ - "Is it DXMP clan? HK forums, /KOW\007 /KOW\MooSting%, 2004 Nov, " - this is possibly a DXMP clan, 007 was a member of community around that time and they registered close with DXMP players, but I have no evidence of it.</li>
                            <li>][GoB][ - My week 3 clan idea after starting and seeing others in clans? No clue what it meant. [DefaultPlayer] Name=][GoB][Rån£12¤€M - I mightve tried to make a clan instead joining one, but soon id be in TSS, im guessing this tag was never a thing</li>
                            <li>Alie[SoJ] - (quaja@) from Japanese community appears once, but may be a visiting tag although others in their server made 1man (or larger) clans</li>

                            <li>Fear wears unknown [DB] tag on a sshot dated around REN times, supposedly Sept 2008. I somehow doubt its Deus Brawlers(?) and since its accompanied by [Urb] tag it may be clan from another game (Fear cant remember either, mightve been temp tag)</li>
                            <li>The X Clan involvement in DXMP is not clear, its a multi-game group that was signed for the continuously evolving DX League (IDXL + DXL) and possibly was seen playing DXMP 0a even years later while somehow getting involved (absorved?) with HK. It was later said X clan was organizing league or tournament, but not clear which one. https://web.archive.org/web/20030211120127/http://www.xclancentral.net/index.cfm</li>

There´s a petition out there right now asking us to do multiplayer versions of our future games, but I really think we´re better off--and players are better served--if we focus on what we do best, which is providing a first-rate, single-player, story-based, character-driven experience.</q>

            <h1>Deus Ex: Clan Wars</h1>
            <p>The idea of multiplayer for Deus Ex seems to have been persistently in the back of mind for Warren Spector and our very own DXMP was described as them learning how to make an online game. While DX2 was already very much on production/preproduction rails and likely by contracts already slated to be consoles-first, the name of their serious online game plan indicates that developer or publisher had taken note of the happenings of our community - after all, bulk of DXMP life lived on two different Ion Storm forums, brought to them by [BH] Black Hand, [DEA] Deus Ex Assassins, [DUI] Deusing Under Influence and [S]talkers. I don't currently have good source in what capacity this idea ended up on the table of the publisher, but it seems they took charge of it even without Ion Storm.</p>
            <p>This game that you've never heard of comes from our publisher Eidos Interactive, and was handed to previously aquired developer Crystal Dynamics thats lately known for new Tomb Rider games.</p>
            <div id="quotecontainer">
                <div id="quotecontent">
                    <div id="quoteauthor">
                        Developer's wikipedia page <span>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Dynamics#Taking_over_Tomb_Raider_for_Eidos_Interactive_(2001%E2%80%932009)" class="reflink">2001–2009</a>)</span>:
                    </div>
                        <q>The publisher also sought a first-person shooter with a sci-fi setting akin to Deus Ex, ultimately mandating it be part of the series.<br /><br />This decision was reversed six months before the game's completion, and it was released as Project: Snowblind in 2005.</q>
                </div>
            </div> 
            <p>So we had a Deus Ex series game required to be made by the publisher seeing what a hit DX1 was, and 6 months before release in  February 22, 2005 - that just weeks after Ion Storm death on February 9 - it was suddenly rebranded. Lets take a look at what happened six months earlier, then: DX2 had been out from half a year to nearly a year (North America), the publisher considered it a commercial success and indeed within next years it sold similar amount of copies as DX1, perhaps due to the console strategy, but the fanbase saw the sequel largely as a failure due to many reasons starting from design and ending with a bad port over to PC. I personally would have expected publisher to can it due to poor sales - and indeed it was likely underperforming when so many fans disliked it - but to my surprise the numbers on paper seem to have looked OK, therefore the decision to rebrand Clan Wars likely had to do with preserving the franchise instead disintegrating it further, as well as comparing the product at the time against previous titles.</p>
            <p>Now called Project Snowblind, upon release it was criticized for its inactive multiplayer. We do see gameplay with augmentations here, some aimable turrets, yet there is a distinct style of TV games to it. You now have rigid classes to pick from while our game has emergent classes from dynamic gameplay, class elements such as deployable shields also very relevant today, gametypes that involve capturing nodes. Theres the 5 second Cloak aug that eats good 33% of bio on activation, bullet time aug seemingly of same duration. It all appears generic with nothing particular making it really stand out, now part of an unknown title it seems to bring a lot of what we already criticized about DX2, and with that dated look had no chance to compete with the online shooter superpowers at the time, but really not living up to the standards of even the old classics. Watch some gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKBrht3dk4w" class="reflink">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTSjevFmC4k" class="reflink">here</a>.</p>

            <h1>Crysis</h1>
            <p>Perhaps ironically dying on the same day as DXMP with the 2014 loss of GameSpy umbilical cord, occasionally some vets have pointed at Crysis as the next DXMP. With few similarities to DXMP this game did see a more polished sequel one year later in shape of Crysis Wars. We got drivable vehicles that technically were possible in Clan Wars also, large campaign maps, controllable turrets again, and what appear to be speed, bally and likely cloak "augs" as elements of the worn nanosuit - but seemingly active only one at a time. Apparently theres even a day-night cycle, bringing us the more familiar night time missions. Looking at high quality modern gameplay, the second Crysis certainly looks like what DXMP2 should've looked like, but aside great looks and professional flow it lacks all the elements that make DXMP, and we could mimic its gameplay in zero augs using vest items. See it for yourself with an example of first Crysis MP <a href="https://youtu.be/hMLRX-ztWoc?si=dR2_K45iQLnpZsBq&t=108" class="reflink">here</a>, and Crysis Wars gameplay <a href="https://youtu.be/_spycI5p5wc?si=9kxH_cSkZ7UEjkQy&t=58" class="reflink">here</a>.</p>

        <div id="chapter">

            <p>DXMP we're familiar with is in small and clearly defined mission locations that ensure complete focus and any custom maps that 'go exploring' are generally not received well. We do want more secluded corners to stock up while our team carries, but never should be far from the enemy. While some Snowblind maps appear to follow same logic, with Crysis we can already see a more Campaign like focus which really is a niche of its own: we're essentially comparing HL2DM, Quake or CS to something like Battlefield. Not only do you get higher quality by focusing on specific style - in our case it would be arena type locations then - but I would wager that the uniquely high-engagement mechanics combined with their potent impact on game are enough to drive the player adrenaline high enough that then spending a minute driving some kind of car somewhere middle of nowhere doesn't really fit into the flow well. And it is exactly this input-rich gameplay that sets us apart and could be seen equally as interesting as well as complex by publishers. DXMP also very uniquely allows player to dynamically generate their own class, which by marketing team could be seen as lacking flashy features and sexy avatars while I - perhaps with a slight bias - think it is amazing, and that it does not have to exclude said sexy avatars.</p>
            <p>Our game is Challenging, Risky, and Stylish. And thats the way we like it.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately it also means that no other game is hitting those notes, making those decisions about gameplay, willing to take the risk and cater to a more intelligent and quick-witted playerbase. I think when you don't have a chance to take market over from Fortnite or Valorant with these parameters then you might as well create your own niche and do it well. Decades of playtesting with those who adapted to software bugs has shown that our two upgradable skill levels (out of three max) and some dozen concurrent augmentations in two choices together offer an experience complex enough to be very fun, but not so complex to require mad grind and saving some sort of stats somewhere while you go to sleep. In our game you could go from zero to hero in a minute only to lose it all to a team mates rocket a second later - and thats totally part of the fun, offering so much variety to what might just be getting an AWP to the face when you peek out from behind a corner. I'm not saying it doesn't happen here, but that it is part of a much, much richer featureset.</p>
            <p>We must make choices about what weapon we take, what augmentation we choose over its alternative and also in what order we want access to it, then decide how we approach a map that has visibly weakened as well as strengthened opponents. We must use very differently behaving weapon classes well at different handling and damage levels, against opponents with different protection layers. We must use all of our augmentations at the same time but cannot afford to use any of them, forcing us to prioritize, minmax, adapt to different drains and think ahead how to manage energy. And lastly, those enhancements we need to activate and watch over like hawks, anticipating the rewards that come with hard-earned frags: they make a huge difference - and were talking double to triple digits, not some kind of passive single digits temporary ticking random pickup. Were talking shrugging off rockets fired at you with no damage while you just stand and watch them, or even entire anti-tank rounds via synergies from stacked augs.</p>

        <div id="chapter">

            <h1>Developer</h1>
            <p>Focus needs to be clear, code needs to be inputs and network first, from experienced hands. Deus Ex has small specific locations, even when scaled to compounds and cathedrals, and gives player some two dozen potentially simultaneous inputs, many of upgradable benefit. The game does not look like a Disney film: the Blade Runner and Matrix in their style have not let audience down. While best and proven current online shooters have user interface and QoL nuances to learn from, team should not be afraid to make their own decisions for a unique experience in line with overall style, in my personal opinion geared towards minimal interface clutter and realistic feedback. As an online game has the online component, the release should have a fairly feature rich front end support for community, at minimum providing avatars of some customization potential and with room for future additions if decided so, ideally also statistics and accounts to promote and highlight. Any alternative ideas without 20 years of playtested experience to lean on as to what else a Deus Ex game could look in online form are not within the scope of this discussion and I don't have an opinion about them to share.</p>

            <h1>Publisher</h1>
            <p>Publisher needs confidence, in shape of pre-existing examples of overlapping content aspects, that a product of Matrix-like style and prestige yet with complex gameplay is able to sell well, even better if with additional long-term profitability. I think it is possible to find that overlap and instill that confidence, while maintaining a product that is unique on the market.</p>
 

            <h1>Modder</h1>
            <p>Online game needs to perform and respond well, and if you are going to recreate something you should have good understanding of what made it so good, as well as what flaws people kept pointing at over the years, perhaps even leading them to leave the scene. There is a logic to maps you make, specifically that it should support the available feature set as well as the flow of the game, but its also possible to do it through trial and error within pre-existing community and then judge by votes if you got such luxury. It is difficult to develop something you are not personally skilled and experienced in, but recreating elements with same timing and other numerical values could go a long way. The goals scale to team size, and if you are the entire team then take on small goals or at least iterate rapidly.</p>

All of these factors led to a highly charged environment, every bit as dramatic as it was competitive. There were a few drastically different game modes developed by the community, but nothing fueled the conflicts like the rise of Custom DM servers with augs set to 0 and skills set to max - akin to other trending realism shooters then.</p>

                        <p>Many thanks go to everyone who helped give some details and provide memories for various clans, [A]lpha guys, Clix, Fear, Kai, Moop, Rec, some Triad I spoke with - also to their quite large clan list with links - and many others that I bothered on messengers :)</p>
                        <p>Particular thanks go to Casper who inspired me to start this project with his own list, found here at the bottom, to the [3] Marathon games that sparked interest in the past of DXMP, and also to Imperial and Alpha forums crowd for their list that allowed me to update this project past year 2006 and add a bunch of community links!</p>
                        <p>Additional thanks have to go to Hasharin from {E.d.H} whose insanely large list of tags found <a href="https://www.palimpalem.com/3/esquadradelhierro/index.html?body3.html" class="pagelink">here</a> allowed me add another 160 or so clans, other times adding more information to what was already published here, however more work is needed to fill in detail.</p>
                        <p>This list was made by a player who started in 2004, so I don't have first hand experience with the years leading up to it, nor necessarily remember what happened afterwards - I've heavily relied on the help from other community members to fill in the gaps.</p>
                        <p>The list is commentable online now in spreadsheet format and I will also work to fill in some trivia for various clans as people find something the recall. To issue your corrections and additions you can just dump all text into single cell comment <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U_kO_x1JqHxgYVjqiry01GEYcjJp19Doiqgdjzw2Jjo/edit#gid=0" class="pagelink">here</a> and let me handle the formatting later.</p>
                        <p>As of April 2023 all links are checked and majority are now archived snapshots, so I dont expect major changes. However, waybackmachine can now load some of the previously dead Flash sites which is really cool - try different snapshots to see what works.</p>
                        <p>With the last updates I've also started using cell notes to list full rosters and any additional information, but the list is by no means complete and likely never will be: its just a community resource improved as people have time or feel nostalgic.</p>

                        <p>Clans are a unique part of online gaming experience that add a tremendous amount of extra content for the player, often making the difference between playing a few days or a few decades. Someone who is not in a clan is often perceived as a nobody: a transient, temporary name that is neither likely to stay long nor expected to play well (otherwise he might not stay "clanless" for long). The significance of clans is so profound that players who have lost clan or are unable to join one due to socializing barriers will often make up a tag just for themselves, either to replace lost tag so it doesnt feel or look weird or genuinely start up a 1-man clan.</p>
                        <p>First clans in DXMP formed in the first days or even hours of Beta release, and the last ones over two decades later.</p>
                        <p>Clans of Deus Ex, thank you for making the game interesting.</p>
